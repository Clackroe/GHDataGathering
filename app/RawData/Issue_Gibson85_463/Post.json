I shouldn't complain about software I had nothing to pay for, but have you ever heard something about quality management? You are releasing a version 1.0.0 that is simply not working. How couldn't this be seen? Then a few days later a \"fixed\" version 1.0.1 still not working. And the same with the versions in the past. Fatal errors over errors again. If you have no linux pc please install yourself a virtual machine and have at least a try before releasing such an sh... It's an effort from < 1 hour.\r\n\r\nPLEASE improve your testing in future.
