The implication being that an understanding of .Net Native characteristics requires different design choices.\r\n\r\nIt's a very convenient way of saying that the bug I had in my code was a bug with my design rather than the .Net Native compiler even though my code did/should work in any given .Net runtime context, but .Net Native is special, thus requiring special design considerations.\r\n\r\n@AArnott, before you close this issue you will have to adjust where you point the finger.  The problem isn't with MessagePack, according to @MichalStrehovsky the problem is your design choice since you, being on the inside of Microsoft, have an even better understanding of the way the .Net Native compiler works.\r\n\r\nOr, the problem is the .Net Native compiler documentation because even Microsoft staff are not aware of the design considerations they have to employ to build products that support Microsoft tech.\r\n\r\nOr, the problem is the way Microsoft operates internally because you folks are prepared to ignore each other and go off to build tooling that your customers are unable to use.\r\n\r\nOr, the problem is Microsoft knows what the future holds, and dumps technology support for its existing tech knowing that that tech is about to be invalidated by what comes next.\r\n\r\nThere are several other logical or cases.  You get the point.\r\n\r\nThis issue is not related to MessagePack.  I don't want it swept under the rug because either Microsoft is here to support the developers using its tech, or Microsoft does as it pleases regardless of how it affects the developers it has convinced to use its tech.\r\n\r\n@AArnott, I suggest you run this by your bosses.

That comment is specifically to the behavior of the `Assembly.Location` API that returns the documented value when there's no filesytem location for the loaded assembly. .NET Native compiles apps into a single file and the original assemblies are gone. It has no choice but to return the only possible documented value. It could also throw, but that won't help in grpc's case either.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid you're sidetracking this discussion in a way that won't help you get a resolution in streamjsonrpc. I don't see `Assembly.Location` being called within this repo. Do you have an error message or a repro so that we can act on this?",

You folks are well aware of the .Net Native problems and design considerations.  The developer of MessagePack and @AArnott's contributions to that code base are not at fault here.  @AArnott is a very smart fellow as are you @MichalStrehovsky.\r\n\r\nIt may be a PITA to have .Net Native issues surfaced this way.  However, that's the real problem and characterizing it any other way is also a problem.  Sadly, I'm not expecting Microsoft to do anything other than replace the .Net Native compiler with whatever the new .Net Core AOT strategy will be.  Until that happens, you folks need to own up to where things are really headed.\r\n\r\nIt's obvious the reboot is well on the way.  Just say so and stop pretending that any of the .Net Native compiler problems will actually be addressed.  A year went by on the gRPC issue.  A year with no resolution!  I'd even be ok with a form of admission and a statement along the lines that we need to resolve these issues ourselves.   At least that way, time wouldn't be wasted on false expectations.\r\n\r\nThis library is a nice piece of work.  I'd like to be able to use it.",

More developers use .NET Core proper, so hopefully they'll be more incentivized to fix the problem. I'm sorry that you're ending up being a hostage to them ignoring the problem. Single file compilation greatly improves startup time of apps and simplifies the distribution a lot - that's why a of users are asking for that mode and we're going to add it outside .NET Native too. But some APIs simply don't make sense in that mode. `Assembly.Location` is one of those.\r\n\r\nAs I said, if you can get me the error message or repro for the streamjsonrpc issue I might be able to help you make progress on that one.

Please consider yourself warned. Please read that code of conduct before submitting anything further to this or other Microsoft OSS repos.\r\n\r\nBy publishing and sharing StreamJsonRpc with the world, Microsoft hasn't committed to supporting it in every use case. Microsoft Support is something agreed upon between Microsoft and individual customers on a per-product basis. StreamJsonRpc is only officially supported in contexts where it ships with Microsoft products that are under support agreements. In other words, we are not obligated to make it work for you in .NET Native and have never made a promise that we would do so.\r\n\r\nJust because Microsoft makes two technologies does not guarantee that those technologies can work together. And just because I work at Microsoft doesn't mean I have any deeper understanding of the .NET Native toolchain than you do. Microsoft is a big place and one team rarely has unique insights into what another team/product is doing.\r\n\r\nFurther, you have yet to share any evidence that this is a StreamJsonRpc flaw at all. MessagePack clearly has issues on .NET Native, but StreamJsonRpc's support for MessagePack *as an option* hardly means that we're responsible to make MessagePack (a 3rd party OSS library) work under every possible Microsoft runtime. I expect you can use StreamJsonRpc on UWP just fine in its default configuration, although I haven't tested that nor are we promising support for that. \r\n\r\nNow if MessagePack proclaims support for .NET Native, and StreamJsonRpc *still* doesn't work on that platform, then re-opening an issue on this repo with the specific error you're seeing is welcome and subject to our limited capacity to offer free OSS support we may take a look at the problem and suggest how you can make it work or possibly offer a fix.\r\n\r\nIt's not just design choices -- there are simply features that .NET Native doesn't support. Some of these reasons I understand and some I don't. But this library does not nor I imagine ever will limit its feature set to what's available on the least capable of Microsoft platforms. For example we support dynamically generated client proxies, which is a great feature that I don't know if it can be used with .NET Native (even without MessagePack). Given dozens of applications and millions of users benefit from this feature, we wouldn't remove it or have suppressed its development just because it can't ever work on a platform that no one even asked for support for before now.\r\n\r\nSo as I stated before, I'm closing this issue because there's no reason to believe a fix is required in this repo. We will keep the .NET Native issue on messagepack open because we expect code fixes are required in that repo.",

You presented several alternatives and said it was one of those.

We haven't tested it. But most code does Just Work on .NET Native, so my surprise that I expressed in my first comment was mild surprise that StreamJsonRpc wasn't among those things that Just Work. But it wasn't intended to express our current support for UWP.\r\n\r\n> When you stated \"I'm surprised if it doesn't work.\" You gave yourself away. \r\n\r\nWhat do you mean? \"You gave yourself away\" makes it sounds like you're saying I accidentally revealed something. I don't feel that way. The intent of all my interactions on this issue should have conveyed:\r\n\r\n1. We don't support UWP, but it might just work\r\n1. We don't keep open issues on a repo for which no code defects are present, or to support scenarios that we don't intend to support.\r\n\r\nAt some point, we might add UWP tests to this repo in which case we'll claim to support UWP. But even then, we might scope the supported feature set down to those that actually work on .NET Native. \r\n\r\n> because you closed the very issue that you had identified as the point of failure.\r\n\r\nWhich issue was that?\r\nYou opened this one, and two over at MessagePack that I'm aware of:\r\nhttps://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/issues/840\r\nhttps://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/issues/839\r\n\r\nI closed the above two because we already have an active issue tracking UWP support in MessagePack (https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/issues/563). We only need one per repo with a defect.\r\nI closed *this* vs-streamjsonrpc issue because there's no bug here AFAIK, as the only issues I've seen are actually failures in MessagePack to support UWP, which we can discuss over at https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/issues/563.",
