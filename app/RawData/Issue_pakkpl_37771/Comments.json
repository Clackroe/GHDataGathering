        "body": "> Nice, the only notable contribution you've ever made anywhere on Github is making sure everyone at Google knows you're a racist.\r\n\r\nWhat's racist about it? Also don't shame others based on their skills and development experience. That's against the code of conduct.\r\n\r\n> BlackLivesMatter is not meant to be a racist statement, except you see it like this.\r\n\r\n\"All lives matter\" isn't racist either, yet [apparently saying that makes you a white supremacist](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37407#issuecomment-637864531) or something.\r\n\r\n> that's problem in USA only\r\n\r\nPrecisely this. Angular/Google are just using the platform to promote their local political views on the matter. It reminds me of the day when gay marriage was legalized in the US and Stack Overflow celebrated it with a rainbow logo.  [This answer explained it nicely](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/298045/2131286):\r\n\r\n>The owners and operators of Stack Exchange and Stack Overflow have made it amply clear that while we as users and contributors are not permitted to use the site and our audience here to promote our political and social beliefs, they, as the owners may.\r\n\r\nWith an unfortunate conclusion:\r\n\r\n> If you do not like this you should no longer contribute to Stack Exchange.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there's not much you can do about it. People can express their opinions but the mods are just gonna lock it away \"cause y'all can't behave\" and \"the discussion is getting out of hand and is not productive anymore\".\r\n\r\n> Anyone have a list of other political movements endorsed by the Angular site?\r\n\r\nFrom the top of my head, previously it's been determined that [blacklist and whitelist is racist](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28529). Funny how the first comment is being sarcastic about [the master branch](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28529#issuecomment-460658997) and that [is actually non-ironically happening now](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-alternative-term-to-avoid-slavery-references/), because apparently there exist people who hear \"master\" and immediately think about slavery. I guess I'll give up my Master's degree to show solidarity.\r\n\r\n[Also a man being smart is sexist towards women because why not.](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/25643)\r\n\r\nNot really political, but I get the same vibe from [stating that simple things are simple offends beginners](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33209).",

In this context, it's undermining the BLM movement where special attention is warranted for the systemic discrimination over many many years.\r\n\r\nThe discussion is not about whether you should support a movement or not; it's about why is it on the front-page of a TypeScript platform for building web, mobile and desktop applications. Yes, black lives matter, white lives matter, Asian lives matter, Latino lives matter, gay lives matter, lesbian lives matter, vegan lives matter, stutterer lives matter, little people lives matter, disabled lives matter, left-handed people lives matter, colorblind lives matter. \r\n\r\nThe question is, why is it on the front-page of Angular and **what is the criteria** which determines what gets on the front page. **Who decides what's important enough?**\r\n\r\nThe very fact that these discussions \"produce heat\" is an indication that people are divided on it. If everyone really agreed that the banner makes sense on the Angular's front page, there wouldn't be an issue about it and [the original PR](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/37407) wouldn't have been locked immediately. If you're so sure that it's such a good idea, why do you have to act so quick about locking it so as not to give people a chance to give their opinion on the matter?\r\n\r\nAgain, Angular team is not required to provide an answer. They can just lock this thread again with a generic \"we care about everyone and we hear y'all, we'll talk it internally, we promise \ud83d\udd12\", and there's nothing anyone can do about it -- legally or otherwise. It's their framework and their repo; as long as they abide the GitHub rules, they're fine. Even if they don't, it's up to GitHub to punish them if they break it.\r\n\r\nBut it just feels less and less a framework and more and more a political board. \"Something happened in America that aligns with who Imma vote for soon? LETS POST IT NOW, QUICK\" \"[Highly voted issues from 2016?](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) crickets [crickets](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/15280#issuecomment-584121619) crickets\"",
