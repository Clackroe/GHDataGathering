I can think of three ways to fix it (in rough preference order):\r\n1. Remove the memoization. This was [previously done](https://github.com/rails/globalid/commit/67a2b76e03345b7a68ef5fee91e815de49e0bed7) for `to_signed_global_id`.\r\n2. Implement `dup` in `GlobalID::Identification` and have it clear the memoized ivar then call `super`. Need some testing to make sure AR's `dup` and GlobalID's `dup` compose correctly, but it should be doable.\r\n3. Clear `@global_id` in `ActiveRecord::Core#dup`. This is very straightforward but creates a difficult-to-maintain coupling between the two libraries.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to send a PR if the Rails team can give me some guidance on the best approach here.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: master\r\n**GlobalID version**: master\r\n\r\nI initially ran into this bug on Rails 5.2.1 - the relevant GlobalID code has been in place for 3 years, so this bug likely exists on many Rails versions.",
