Whoever came up with this idea clearly doesn't understand why ESLint was created in the first place. There are plenty of domains where you would like to give a function a name beginning with \"use\". Not all of us are React developers and we shouldn't have to change code in unrelated parts of the application.\r\n\r\nWe're having a real problem with this because ESLint ignores the .eslintrc.json file (due to some other bug in ESLint), and it breaks the build.\r\n",
