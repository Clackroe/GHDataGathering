It's a possible option but security is also important. For me official vagrant boxes from folks like puppetlabs hosted on Atlas are so slow to download at times that I wish this issue could be resolved. For internal vagrant boxes that I build for my company we have the option to host on S3 or Artifactory or private Atlas org.\n\n@mitchellh - yes - curl is just as slow (for me). I don't think it is a Vagrant issue - but a backed server hosting issue. Granted - not a Vagrant issue per se. \n",

I killed it and tried again using the exact same command, and got 29 MiB/sec. \n\nI think @mitchellh is correct in that this doesn't really seem like a Vagrant issue. If anything, it seems more like an Atlas issue (so possibly the ELB and/or whatever's sitting behind it). I highly doubt it has anything to do with the routes or hops between end-users and the ELB VIPs -- you wouldn't typically see such a polarizing set of speeds in that case, especially considering both VIPs terminate in us-east-1.\n\nIf for no other reason, it'd be highly desirable to see these made available through a CDN rather than a centrally-located ELB. Then again, I'm just one guy (who isn't paying for this service), so take that for what it's worth. Pretty thankful it's there either way.\n",
