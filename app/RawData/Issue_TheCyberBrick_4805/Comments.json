Player's dimension: -1 <--- -1 is the world you get from event.getPlayer().world, which is not the world the chunk was in (overworld/dim 0)\r\nUnwatching chunk [46, -59] in dimension 0.

Player's dimension: -1\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could be fixed with a workaround by keeping track of the player's previous dimension somewhere, but to me this looks more like an oversight in the event.\r\nThis PR would prevent that pitfall and event handlers wouldn't need that workaround.\r\n\r\nEdit: The player's and chunk's world will always be the same for ChunkWatchEvent.Watch. I've added the world reference to ChunkWatchEvent though because event handlers can listen to that one too.",
