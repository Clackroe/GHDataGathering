    "body": "This PR adds a getter for the world of the chunk that was un-/watched.\r\nThis is useful because when the player is teleported to another dimension with `PlayerList#transferPlayerToDimension` the player's world is set to the new dimension before the ChunkWatchEvent.UnWatch events are called. Because of that there's no way of actually knowing in which world the chunk was unwatched by just using the event.\r\nSpecifically mods that need to keep track of which players are watching which chunks need this.\r\nThe additional getter and comment should also make it clear that the player's world may not be the same as the world of the chunk that was unwatched.\r\n",
