This also seems like something Gradle should handle, though I'm not at all familiar with the Gradle codebase so I have no idea what is actually involved in fixing it. If it's too problematic for Gradle to follow symlinks, let me know and I'll get us to budget some time to workaround on our end. Thanks.\r\n\r\n",
