According to http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//people/jeff/BayLearn2015.pdf, both data and model parallel are needed to train large and powerful models quickly. BTW, GPUs transferring data takes time as described in http://tensorflow.org/tutorials/deep_cnn/index.md. Then, how it's possible to efficiently support both model parallelism and heterogeneous multi-devices (of a single node) on distributed cluster? Could you please roughly explain how different it from DistBelief?\n\nThanks!\n",

Since a large amount of memory is required for fully-connected layers, I was thought that Pregel-like model parallelism on CPUs w/ vertical partitioning is more attractive for fully connected layers (blocking mat-mult on GPU also appears to me slow and memory demanding). Of course, I maybe wrong but that's why I launched Apache Horn project recently. Since layers can be pipelined, I hope we can collaborate each projects in complementary way.\n",
