Salt SSH still needs to have both library sets (dependencies) on the Master for the specific Python versions, so the `.tar.gz` is carrying over those in `py<major version>` subdirectories.\r\n\r\n@dincamihai NOTE: actually if you are running Salt on a Master from the specific version, you _do not_ need to install Salt again for the alternative version, as it is anyway works for both versions. This is just packaging convenience. But in fact you need only couple of version-specific libraries to be installed so they will be picked up by the `thin` creation procedure. That is, probably we should not say \"install Salt for alternative Python X\" (which implies you will get all the needed dependencies automatically), but \"install Salt _dependencies_ only for the alternative Python X\".\r\n\r\n@gtmanfred nope, this is only needed in Fluorine.",
