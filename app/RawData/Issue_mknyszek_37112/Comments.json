Luckily, the case you're worried about came up in the intervening months, and the way I addressed it is by making the resulting `Value` have `Kind` `KindBad` if a metric doesn't exist. It's not an explicit `error` value returned by `Read`, but it does signal the issue (and it does seem right to set this anyway, even if we do decide on returning an explicit `error` value, too).

And there are third-party tooling, that pulls the data from `expvar` into different metrics collectors.\r\n\r\nNow it feels confusing why std has two ways of exposing its internal stats.",

        "body": "@narqo Yeah, I'm happy to update both the proposal and the documentation. I'll make sure it happens before the release.\r\n\r\nThe short answer to the relationship between the two is that `runtime/metrics` is low-level, and intended to be a replacement for `ReadMemStats`. `ReadMemStats` has problems for us in terms of exposing statistics that are useful to us for both debugging and evolving the runtime. Future evolution of `runtime/metrics` could also involve \"push\" metrics (\"time series data\") instead of just \"pull\" metrics (\"sampled data\") which doesn't quite fit with `expvar`'s model, so I think having a separate, underlying package still makes sense.\r\n\r\nAnother point here is that despite its use of string keys, `runtime/metrics` is actually much lower-level API that puts a lot of focus on efficiency at the price of usability. AFAICT, isn't really the case with `expvar` (despite some performance improvements I see that were made a few years ago).\r\n\r\nI filed another issue to try to figure out how `runtime/metrics` should be exported through `expvar` (#43555) because I am honestly not 100% sure. I think I'm personally slightly leaning toward re-exporting `runtime/metrics` up through `expvar` as one big blob, but I have some concerns with just doing that.\r\n\r\nThank you for your input here, and please feel free to start/continue the discussion on #43555.",
