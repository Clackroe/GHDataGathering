For example, assuming user Joe has the following file structure:\n\n```\n/home/joe/proj/foo/bar/baz.dart\n  import '../qux.dart';\n  class C extends B {}\n/home/joe/proj/foo/qux.dart\n  export '../thud.dart';\n/home/joe/proj/thud.dart\n  class B {}\n```\n\nIn the summary for `/home/joe/proj/foo/bar/baz.dart` we want to record that class C extends class B, and that class B came originally from the file `/home/joe/proj/thud.dart`.  But we don't want to encode the absolute path `/home/joe/proj/thud.dart` in the summary file, because that would make the summary unusable if Joe decided to share this code with some other user.  So instead we use the relative path from `/home/joe/proj/foo/bar/baz.dart` to `/home/joe/proj/thud.dart`, which is `../../thud.dart`.  The easiest way to compute this path is to use Uri.resolveUri to resolve `../thud.dart` relative to `../qux.dart`.\n",
