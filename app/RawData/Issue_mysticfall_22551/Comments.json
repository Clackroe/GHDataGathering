Right now it's really confusing for newcomers for no reason at all. \r\n\"Duplicate\", \"Copy and Paste\" and \"Create Instance\" are used interchangeably while they are actually vastly different operations but sometimes do the same and then again different things within Godot. For example if you rightclick and select \"Duplicate\" a scene in the filebrowser panel, you create a true duplicate of that scene. Whereas if you rightclick and \"Duplicate\" a Node in the  Scene Panel, you create an instance. One example of many.",
