I agree that the other project has huge problems!\"\r\n\r\n> How do you feel about addressing those issues? Is it doable? May be a fork?\r\n\r\nSorry, this isn't really much of a question appropriate for the issue tracker. This is more of a Call For Hot Takes, which is not particularly helpful here IMO.\r\n\r\nMany of the core devs on Node.js have commented (e.g. on Twitter) on what aspects of the presentation they agree with and disagree with. You can do some web searches if you really care what the core devs think. Or maybe a few will weigh in here. (Sorry, I won't be one of them.)\r\n\r\nIf you have a very specific question, feel free to post it in an appropriate forum. Depending on the question, this issue tracker *might* be the right forum.\r\n",

Some of these so-called \"core problems of node.js\" are just unimportant things we'll have to keep supporting or else break the entire ecosystem. So no, they won't get \"fixed\". But they're also not \"broken\". For example, supporting \"index.js\" as the default file for modules is maybe a less-than-perfect original decision, but now that there are hundreds of thousands of modules that do this, we're not going to change. The benefit of changing is negligible and the cost of changing is enormous.",

May be a fork?\r\n\r\nI believe most of the points raised in the talk are not new to the project, but out of compatibility concerns it would be hard to do anything about them at this point. Deno is new and is free to experiment with ideas, but Node.js cannot afford that luxury with the enormous user base and the existing code out there - people may be upset when the existing design is not perfect, but they are usually more upset when their working code gets broken or when they are told to upgrade their massive code base to a more idiomatic style. Starting a general discussion around the issues may be helpful to make progress, but it is likely to go nowhere without anything actionable proposed.\r\n\r\nThe current ways of introducing significant changes into Node.js core are:\r\n\r\n1. Start a working group, or a team, like [nodejs/modules](https://github.com/nodejs/modules), that may or may not does periodic meetings and has their own issue tracker to tackle the cross-cutting concerns and reach consensus before starting the implementation in core\r\n2. Start a new repo under this organization that contains a fork of Node.js core (there is usually a team started for it as well), work on the implementation there and sync with the upstream from time to time, but it's not going to have its own release (maybe that can be improved). When the team thinks it's ready, submit a PR back to the upstream. Past examples that have been merged into core:  [nodejs/http2](https://github.com/nodejs/http2) and [nodejs/abi-stable-node](https://github.com/nodejs/abi-stable-node) (prototype of N-API, you'll need to switch branches to find the prototypes and the collaboration happened there)\r\n\r\nFor both type of efforts we will usually have an item listed in the [strategic initiatives](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/master/Strategic-Initiatives.md) and a champion (usually TSC member) who reports the status of the initiative every week at the TSC meeting, which is live-streamed on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQPYJluYC_sn_Qz_XE-YbTQ) with a public Q&A session (there are also recordings in the channel) and the [meetings minutes are available in the TSC repo](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/tree/master/meetings).\r\n\r\nThe members of those initiatives do not have to be Node.js core collaborators or even members of this organization, but the team will decide how they recruit new members (it's usually a call-for-participants kind of thing). If you want to start an initiative, I think the best way is to [go to the #node-dev IRC](http://nodeirc.info/) and find people who are interested in a particular item, and discuss about starting a new team for it. It is also important to make sure that the stakeholders are aware and willing to participate (like the VM vendors in the case of N-API), reaching out to them in private should help as well. A lot of work (coordination is work and it's hard) would be needed to make this happen so you'll either do it yourself, or find people who are interested in spending their time on that.\r\n\r\nThere used to be [node-eps](https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps) but it's not used anymore.",
