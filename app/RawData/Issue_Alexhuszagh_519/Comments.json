I am, however, amenable to any\n> suggestions the levelDB authors may have.\n>\n\nHere is what I suggest: make a separate Env implementation for Windows\n(instead of attempting to reuse env_posix.cc).  That Env implementation\n(like all other Env implementations), accepts char-based (narrow) strings,\nwhich are always utf8 encoded.  Inside this Env's implementation, it can\nconvert back and forth between the utf8 strings that the rest of leveldb\nassumes, and whatever type is appropriate for windows APIs called in the\nimplementation.\n\nIf there is significant code in env_posix.cc you find yourself needing,\nconsider refactoring that out into a separate .h/.cc (which are private to\nthe leveldb implementation) so you can share the code in your Env\nimplementation.\n\n> *Intellectual Property*\n>\n> To emulate the behavior of mmap on Windows, I used a very lightweight\n> library (<250 lines of code) from Steven Lee, mman-win32\n> <https://github.com/witwall/mman-win32>. However, looking over your\n> contributor license agreement, it seems that my port would not satisfy\n> Google's CLA until I remove this code from my implementation. If this is\n> the case, I could easily use the raw WinAPI functions rather than the\n> emulated mmap in my Windows port. Please notify me if I should remove\n> this code prior to submitting a pull request.\n>\n\nYes, this should be removed.  In general, we have been throttling back mmap\nusage anyway (it helps a bit with microbenchmarks, but causes a bunch of\nportability problems).  So I suggest a good initial start will be to just\nuse raw WinAPI functions.\n\n\n\n> Other Changes\n>\n> *CMake Build System*\n>\n> I introduced a CMake build system, which retains most of the same logic as\n> the existing Makefile. The existing Makefile has not been deprecated.\n>\n*AppVeyor Continual Integration*\n>\n> To ensure builds do not break the Windows builds, I am planning to add an\n> AppVeyor configuration, which allows continual integration on Windows using\n> MSVC.\n>\n\nThis sounds very helpful.\n\n\n> Summary\n>\n> If there is still interest for native Windows support, and the proposed\n> changes are amenable to the levelDB authors, I would gladly submit a pull\n> request.\n>\n\nThis sounds very useful to me.  I would like it if the changes were limited\nto the following:\n\n(a) A windows Env implementation as I mentioned above.\n(b) Build/portability changes.\n\nIs that feasible, or you are seeing the need to make widespread changes?\n\n\n\u2014\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/google/leveldb/issues/519>, or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AHuM0W8xE_w2Az-r6NfZqQwYWM9ZBrNVks5stQmLgaJpZM4P8vz1>\n> .\n>\n",

I went with:\r\n\r\n> 2. Converting all narrow strings from UTF-8 to UTF-16 before calling WinAPI functions.\r\n\r\nIt also leads into long path issues on Windows. I took an approach similar to the one CMake took for their Windows port, a `longpath` helper to translate all paths as they reach WinAPI functions from UTF-8 to UTF-16 with `\\\\?\\` prepended if necessary. My helper is [here](https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/3rdparty/stout/include/stout/internal/windows/longpath.hpp) (note that the max path is _not_ 255 despite documentation).\r\n\r\nI need to stress: native long path support is probably a must for most Windows projects nowadays. It's not terribly difficult to do, it's just _really annoying_.\r\n\r\nAlso, for your comment:\r\n\r\n> is the least amenable for me since the expected encoding for paths from levelDB would then conflict with the entirety of the WinAPI\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I entirely agree, there is no data loss going from UTF-8 to UTF-16. Both encodings are _Unicode_, it's just an implementation difference. Plus, you can do the conversion [natively in C++11](https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/f599839bb854c7aff3d610e49f7e5465d7fe9341/3rdparty/stout/include/stout/stringify.hpp#L57). Anyway, I've not had any problems on Windows having gone this route so far.\r\n\r\nThanks for your work! I personally know the trouble it is \ud83d\ude09 ",

        "body": "Everything has been patched, and I am adding extended file length support currently. @andschwa, for the extended file length support, since the `\"\\\\?\\\"` prefix effectively removes all path parsing, do you know if there's anything else I need to consider other than:\r\n\r\n1. Relative paths (which cannot use the extended file length prefix).\r\n2. `/`, `.`, or `..` in paths (somewhat tricky, see below).\r\n\r\nFor the `.` and `..` operators, manually parsing them is somewhat tricky, since directory symbolic links may be in play. The only time-tested strategy for this is to iterate over all roots, parent directories, check to see if the item is a directory symbolic link or junction, get the real path of the directory if it is a symlink or junction, and then continue from there. This is because `C:\\leveldb\\..\\leveldb-1\\README.md` does not actually point to `C:\\leveldb-1\\README.md` if `C:\\leveldb` is a symlink or junction.\r\n\r\nThis is very doable (and is relatively easy to implement), but it is fairly expensive since it requires filesystem calls. It requires a temporary vector to store each path component. Step-wise, the general approach is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Check if the path is absolute (skip remaining steps otherwise).\r\n2. Replace all forward separators with backslashes.\r\n3. Recurse over each parent directory, from the root (drive letter, such as `C:`, or UNC root, such as `\\\\host-name\\share-name`), to the (and excluding the) file (we don't care if the file is a symlink, since relative path components cannot follow it).\r\n4. If the directory basename is `.`, ignore the directory.\r\n5. If the directory basename is `..`, remove the preceding directory component.\r\n6. Otherwise, check if the directory is a symlink by calling `CreateFile` with the `FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT` and `FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS` flags. If the handle is successfully created, it's a symlink, otherwise, it is not.\r\n7. If the directory is a symlink, read the proper path using `DeviceIoControl` with the `FSCTL_GET_REPARSE_POINT` code, and reset the vector using the absolute new path.\r\n\r\nI would be amenable to implementing this (I've done this before, as may be obvious due to the detail of my explanation on how to implement such functionality), but this may add a lot of expense for a feature that application developer should have to be aware of themselves (that is, leveldb will already support an extended length path, if provided by the end-user).\r\n\r\nAnother major caveat is leveldb's filenames are short (the longest being the `MANIFEST-00000X` files, at 15 characters). Since the Windows [documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx) clearly states the maximum directory length must be `MAX_PATH - 12`, even with the extended length path prefix, this seems like a lot of work for an added 3 characters.\r\n\r\n@pwnall, any thoughts? Should extended file length support be added, including with the caveats mentioned above?",

I also specifically use `OPEN_EXISTING`, though you probably got that.\r\n\r\nRe: point 7: I resolve the path using `GetFinalPathNameByHandleW` with the `FILE_NAME_NORMALIZED` flag, after using:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  const DWORD access_flags = resolved_path_is_directory\r\n    ?
