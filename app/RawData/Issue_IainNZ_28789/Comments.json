        "body": ">I'm guilty of not having followed master very closed until recently, so this feedback is indeed a bit late. More than a concern for programmers (most for loops will be inside a function in library code) I'm afraid this is a concern for teaching. Often for loops are taught before functions or scopes (of course you need to understand scopes to really understand what's going on but in teaching things are often simplified).\r\n\r\n>Here it becomes a bit difficult to teach a beginner how to sum numbers from 1 to 10 without explaining functions or global variables.\r\n\r\nThis is a big point. After finding out what the issue really is, it's surprising how little it actually shows up. It is less of an issue with a lot of Julia code in the wild and in tests, and it did reveal a lot of variables which were accidentally global (in both Julia Base's tests according to the original PR, and I noticed this on most of DiffEq's tests). In most cases it seems that the subtly wrong behavior isn't what you get (expecting a change in a loop), but rather expecting to be able to use a variable in a loop is what I've found to be the vast majority of where this shows up in updating test scripts to v1.0. So the good thing is that in most cases the user is presented with an error, and it's not difficult to fix.\r\n\r\nThe bad thing is that it's a little verbose to have to put `global x` inside of the loops, and now your REPL code is also different from the function code. Whether or not it's more intuitive behavior than before is a tough opinion because [there were definitely some edge cases in hard/soft local scoping](http://ucidatascienceinitiative.github.io/IntroToJulia/Html/ScopingExperiment) and so this is clearly easier to explain. But at the same time, while having a much more succinct explanation than the behavior of before, it's now easier to hit the edge cases where understanding scoping rules matters. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. \r\n\r\nI for one would like to see the experiments with `let` blocking. This would keep the \"you didn't really want so many globals\" aspect of it, along with the simplified scoping explanation, while at the same time make REPL code behave like function interiors (which is seemingly what we've always wanted). Or inversely, making people specify variables they want to act as globals\r\n\r\n```julia\r\nglobal x = 5\r\nfor i = 1:5\r\n  println(x+i)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\ncould be a nice way to keep the explicitness, and would make the \"REPL code is slow because of globals\" be much more obvious. The downside is that once again throwing things into a function would not require the `global` markers. \r\n\r\nBut given how this tends to show up, it's not really gamebreaking or a showstopper. I'd classify it as a wart  that should get a mention in any workshop but it's not like v1.0 is unusable because of it. I hope that changing this behavior isn't classified as breaking and require v2.0 though.",

Release a SoftGlobalScope.jl package with the `globalize` etc. functions.\r\n2. Use SoftGlobalScope in IJulia (and possibly Juno, vscode, and OhMyREPL).\r\n3. Fold the SoftGlobalScope functions into a future release of the REPL stdlib package and use it in the REPL.\r\n\r\nOr is it practical to roll it into REPL.jl immediately?  I'm not completely clear on how stdlib updates work in 1.0.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at my implementation, in case I'm missing something that will cause it to be fragile.",

Functions are more fundamental anyway, and this will help set the expectation that code should be written in functions. While I understand the inconvenience, this scoping behavior can be turned into a pedagogical advantage: \"In fact, global variables are such a bad idea, particularly using them in loops, that the language makes you bend over backwards to use them.\"\r\n\r\nAdding a non-default feature to the REPL for this seems ok to me though.",

You can't change the laws of physics so that the electrostatics examples you show to freshman are more applicable to real life.\r\n\r\nSo my question as a non-CS user who also cares about performance is how would I be likely to screw up if this were made the default behavior.
