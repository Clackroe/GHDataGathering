    "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\n@bryanmacfarlane to open this possible enhancement.\r\n\r\nNow PS based task won't even try to run on Linux/MacOS agent because of the missing handler. However, PowerShell is installed on those agents and you have the PowerShell task available for them and works...\r\n\r\nAs Bryan pointed out, custom PS task may have windows assumptions, but that's okay, developers will just have to make those scripts OS aware to avoid those pitfalls. With the handler in place they can see where there scripts fail when running on Linux/MacOS PowerSHell implementation and fix them.\r\n\r\nI think this will open more options to PS developers.\r\nThanks,\r\nJ.",
