We want to avoid a large PR only to be rejected.\r\n\r\nTL;DR;\r\nAs an FYI, here's what we're struggling with internally (and the concepts get confusing so I'll try my best to be concise :) )\r\n\r\nWe have a major shift and feature set around yaml and containers:\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-agent/blob/master/docs/preview/yamlgettingstarted-phase.md#container-applies-to-queue\r\n\r\nThe scenario isn't building / deploying your app container (a prime scenario however) - this one is build and test in a container to seal the dev tools and configs (dev == dev == ci).\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation coming to preview, the agent runs on the host and we exec steps in a container we start up with work dir mapped in.  So single use, incremental source, clean config / machine every time.  The agent can still update forward if demanded, etc...\r\n\r\nThe agent carries everything it needs to to run \"any container you bring\" - outside / in.  It carries node internal as a script engine (mapped in) and stdin/out is the protocol.  Everything is golden with what we support.  Powershell3 is hand wavy but it's ubiquitous and win only right now.\r\n\r\nEnter powershell core and dotnet core (maybe carries dlls).  You need powershell core in the container - OK, that makes sense for a task like pester, azure powershell, etc... - anything that's powershell tech related.  Hey, I add the pester task to my def, say run in my container it makes sense that I need powershell in it.\r\n\r\nNow, write a general task like config file variable substitutions (generic task).  I install from the market place, drag it on, pick my container.  When I run it (if we do it right) we inform you powershell core is not in the container.  The user who added the task from the market place had no idea how you implemented the generic task.  \r\n\r\nSo at this point the only option is to say all containers must contain powershell core or we inject it into the container if missing (not quite immutable :) ).\r\n\r\nNext problem is versions - which version of powershell core to prereq in container?  There isn't one since whatever you pick it to be, what happens when you write a task using capabilities in a later powershellcore?  All the builds with containers that took our prereq advice of installing pscore into the container will break when they add your task from the marketplace that needs a later one.  It's a forward compat problem.\r\n\r\nPotential solution there is to have a handler per maj version channel of pscore but it still has the odd experience of adding a task from the marketplace and having to realize how it was coded.  As pointed out above, the agent currently carries node.  The other option is to explore ways to do the same with powershell core and we're meeting with the ps core team.\r\n\r\nFor those reasons we can't prereq certain versions.  It's also why the agent is built as a self contained net core app - it updates itself as demanded and moves to new net core versions so we can't pre-req one at config time.  \r\n\r\nEverything right now in the agent and the task model is self contained.  OS dependencies of net core is the exception but those are generally going down with new versions of net core.\r\n\r\nSo it's not the implementation time that we're struggling with - it's all the versions and back and forward compat of a service, the agent and tasks on different versions with containers.\r\n\r\nLong winded but hopefully it makes sense.",

That will need to be used anyway for users not using containers as part of their build process. I'm not sure how well those requirements are currently presented to a user when using YAML definitions but I assume it is still done in some way since those requirements will still be there. I'm not sure being in a container has a big impact on the way it should handle this, there will be plenty of times when a user has a definition which doesn't use containers or even YAML defs and so will just be running a def defined in the web UI and we just need to surface the requirements of the various tasks to them in a sensible way.\r\n\r\nSome work would have to be done by extension authors as well to include those requirements in their readme files on the marketplace to ensure that the requirement is known ahead of time. \r\n\r\nAs for versions of PS Core to handle with this, I'd go with the latest minor version of the current major version and the previous one, so currently that's just 6.0.2 but will soon be 6.1.x and eventually will be 7.0.x and 6.x.x . I don't think the PS Team has plans to release major versions too often so that shouldn't mean updating things too often and supporting the current and 1 previous major versions feels like a reasonable amount. From a user perspective if a task changes major versions because it's supporting things in PSCore 8.0 and I want those things then I can just update my dockerfile (or whatever is building my container) to use that newer version, if I don't want/need those new things then I can keep using the old version of the task and my existing container.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how best to handle that from the agent side, a single powershellcore execution handler with some config settings coming from the task.json about what versions it requires/supports, which then lets it swap between the two supported versions of core or full PowerShell if they aren't available.",

The requirement is you install the task from the marketplace and it works.\r\n\r\nEven if you entertained communicating pre-reqs, the problem is shifting pre-reqs.  If you pre-req 1.0 and everyone puts that in their container, when can your task start using capabilities of 1.1?  never.  If they heeded your pre-req at install time and their build works on the container they put your pre-req in, it will blow up when you change your task to code against 1.1 capabilities.  \r\n\r\nThe fundamental problem is you have multiple layers from the agent, tasks and system that float on different lifetimes. That's why the agent and tasks are self contained.  You also have to be crisp between what's a dependency (node) and a tool (what the task is calling - msbuild, etc...).\r\n\r\nNothing is preventing you from creating a task in typescript that calls powershell / pester right now until and if we add this.",

The other approach requires adding checks for that version in your code before trying to use it, which grants more compatability but takes more time and effort on the part of the task author. \r\n\r\nI still think updating for new prereqs is less of a problem for people using containers due to their nature but I know there will be a large number who don't want to change their working container because a task updated a bit. It's also still a bigger problem for people not using containers as that takes more time and effort to roll out new versions of prereqs.\r\n\r\nI'll certainly give some thought to writing a typescript wrapper for the pester task I already have and see how that performs. Hopefully some of these more interesting and difficult design questions can be worked out to enable a PS Core handler.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to explain this stuff Bryan, it's given me a much better idea of how it all hangs together and the things you have to think about when working on the agents.",

They shouldn't have to inspect the tasks code and figure out what it's pre-reqs are.  The requirements are, choose task, use, works.  So market place tasks cannot have pre-reqs.\r\n\r\nFor those reasons, the agent carries the javascript runtime (node).  It's a self contained executable.\r\n\r\nWe also need to make it work in containers since [jobs can run in containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/container-phases?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml).   That includes alpine and we're tracking.  For typescript tasks, we map it into the container (user can pick any container) and at that point it's about the OS pre-reqs which is almost zero for typescript/node.  netcore has been reducing OS dependencies with 2.x and 3.x so we're evaluating.\r\n\r\nAll of this is possible since we could potentially package ps core in the agent but it will take quite a bit of work, docs etc. and we need ps to address the alpine (wasn't there when we last looked).  This is why we've left the issue open.  We're still considering and looking at the work involved.\r\n\r\nNote that you can use the typescript task-lib to exec powershell core against a powershell core your task carries.  That will have the issue mentioned above of a task having a pre-req though.\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "> My understanding is that in order to use typescript, we will end up as an with extra dependency of node\r\n\r\nThat is not correct.  The agent carries node as the task runtime.  It's completely self contained so adding a task from the market place works.  And that's the work that this enhancement needs.\r\n\r\n> a PowerShell Installer task\r\n\r\nThat won't work in container jobs as pointed out above.  Note that a task dependency is different than installing tools in an environment.  The user and consumer of tasks brings tools they use\r\n\r\nNote that we have not said we're not doing this which is why enhancement is still open.   The work is known and it's on our backlog.  The requirements, patterns and expectations have been set for how the type script tasks work.  When we add powershell core support, the requirements are the same and it will need to work for all of our features. \r\n\r\nI would kindly ask that we keep the conversation friendly and respectful.  Please refer to our code of conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/\r\n\r\nWe are keeping this issue open and will address it on our backlog. Thanks for all of your feedback -  All the details and considerations are captured in this issue.",
