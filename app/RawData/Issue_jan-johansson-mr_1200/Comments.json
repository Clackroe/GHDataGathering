Here, I\u2019m thinking about identity information as a universal example. \n\nThe contract-based coding model is really necessary to avoid going back to the string-parsing voodoo that had us living in a type-uncertain, data-validity-in-question wild-west back when Microsoft thought passing hash tables to and from SOAP web services was a good idea. \n",

As you pointed out in the thread, a .NET Core positioned on the client side is in my mind taking away the potential of what .NET Core can be.\n\nI'm sure we all can wire basic communication (TCP, HTTP, ...) and then get bogged down into details about message parsing, to get some implementation of back-end on .NET Core. I'll stick my neck out and  claim that WCF takes a lot of plumbing away from development (reduces waste and error prone code), letting us focus on business value. That is the reason why I enjoy WCF so much, and really would love to see support for server side WCF in .NET Core, rather sooner than later.\n",

We have about 100+ service types, of which in the largest installations there are 700 to 800 concurrent service instances at play. Our product is driving important parts of the core businesses.\n\nThe expenditure on IT is huge for our customers. This is also the place where we are looking to make major improvements over the coming years. A part of that is to find alternative hosting environments. A favorable choice would be Windows Nano, or the .NET Core on Linux. For being able to adopt .NET Core (or Windows Nano) we are missing the WCF server side.\n\nSince we are very happy with WCF as a programming model, there is no incentive to rewrite our applications other than that WCF server side is unavailable in our future hosting environments. Particular features that we use is long. But to start .NET Core adoption are, these are the important ones:\n- Self-hosting using ServiceModel.ServiceHost\n- NetTcp (half-duplex)\n- Message inspectors for instrumentation and access to SOAP headers\n- Behaviours\n- OperationContext\n- Contract based programming model\n\nYes. We would continue building WCF services also on .NET Core.\n",

Nothing out there gives us the same level of flexibility and support for different communication channels like WCF does.\n\nI have been holding back moving to .net core for production environments for the lack of WCF support specifically. Not supporting WCF server on .net core creates a need to rewrite a lot of infrastructure code; which will probably end up mimicking the WCF programming model anyway.\n\nThe biggest solution I worked on was used by over 300 health care institutes, rewriting the server layers and functionalities is a big investment to say the least, not to mention high risk. \nIn fact, in that same solution we were looking at a way to unify the programming model between server and embeded devices (linux) for new products. Supporting WCF services on .net core (not just clients) could've been a really big help and cost saver as there would be no need to have 2 development teams; but in stead have a larger singularly focused team.\n",

Much of this missing capability  would require various 3rd party libraries (or extensive custom code) to fill in the gaps and it's just not worth that level of investment when WCF already works, brilliantly. WCF is, above all else, a great productivity enhancer for my teams.\n\nThe biggest piece missing for me, currently, is the extensibility model that WCF provides. \nMost of my projects leverage the capability to completely decouple cross-cutting concerns from my other components (which are light-weight WCF services). WCF provides a fantastic mechanism for doing this without the need of 3rd party Aspect Oriented Programming libraries. Developers don't know (or even care) and can focus solely on delivering the business value of the features they are concerned with.\n\nWe also leverage many other aspects of WCF such as: \nnamed pipes, transactional queuing programming model, enforcement (not encouragement) of interface-based design, security capabilities, process isolation, error masking, I could go on.\n\nWithout WCF (or equivalent capabilities) in .NET core I would lose way too much productivity and cannot justify the switch. It would be great to have all of these powerful capabilities in a platform that can be used in any type of environment. Imagine, productivity of WCF plus cost-savings of cheaper hosting environments. That is a tremendous business value.\n\nThanks for tracking this issue,\nWill\n",

I have showed them a viable alternative using WCF and named pipes (to give them the isolation they desire without compromising performance). They were even more interested when I showed them that they could then scale these services across machines and across platform (if WCF services were supported on Linux)\n\nSo, this is blocking adoption of .NET Core in this scenario and we would be looking to port existing processes/services to .NET Core as well as developing new services using .NET Core.\n\nDavid\n",

Especially useful are the specific features called out (e.g. queuing, transaction, etc.) because it allows us to prioritize and do targeted investigations.\n\nFor the record, the \"missing\" features of the full .NET framework's WCF were not deliberately excluded from .NET Core WCF. Rather, the initial goal was to support all the existing Windows Store WCF API's on NET Core (which are all client-facing) before tackling other mission-critical features of WCF.  It might help to know that much of the work of porting WCF features involves re-implementing OS-level libraries that WCF depends on (e.g. socket layer, cryptography, etc.) to allow it to work cross-platform. So lighting up WCF features usually involves replacing OS-level libraries for each platform first.  It might help to think that the \"W\" in WCF is no longer a given in NET Core.\n\nThis is one reason why it is so valuable to hear from you which features matter most, because it lets us investigate more deeply questions like \"Which libraries are required to do feature X on Linux? OS X?, etc.\".  Please keep those suggestions and specific scenarios coming!\n",
