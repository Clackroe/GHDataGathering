I didn't realize a 4 line PR would pull me into a discussion on how to improve it by implementing a new code base and consequently figure why shippable would fail. I understand your request but I'm not sure it is the most efficient. Release fast and refactor after by actors that have an interest (they'll make time) in it (dissecting to_list() brings not value to my use case). Look, 24h later, a valid tiny patch is still not merged and we'd need to \"discuss\" why shippable failed on its improvement, not even on the patch itself. It's clearly less effective than merge and refactor later added to the fact I feel my time creating that PR was wasted, so not rewarding, hence I'll think twice before making another PR. There is much more to gain by going fast on smalls steps/iteration and securing what you have asap, that's my way of working anyway so very subjective I'll give you that. Feel free do whatever you see fit, I'm off to other things, good luck & sorry for the noise.",
