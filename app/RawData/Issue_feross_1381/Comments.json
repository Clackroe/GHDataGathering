It reminds me of the OpenCollective-style banners used by webpack / corejs.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/587740/63358843-b47aa700-c339-11e9-991a-0c9f78f51373.png)\r\n\r\nI think it's OK... I do worry that `npm install` will just become a long trail of banner ads though eventually and it won't scale. Because if _every_ npm package adds ads, the noticeability of each ad will diminish. (Interestingly, the most valuable \"realestate\" will be packages whose banner is displayed _last_, so if it becomes a literal \"race-to-the-bottom\" people might add `sleep` statements to their post-install scripts so they are displayed nearest the bottom. What a dystopian installation experience!)\r\n\r\nFun fact: `yarn` does not display the output of post-install scripts. One might say yarn has built-in ad-blocking.",

Thank you so much for your hard work in making a fantastic, easy-to-use, and solid linter.\r\n\r\nI was really taken off guard seeing this in my terminal today. It's the last place I expect to see an ad, and really the last place I want to. While I get the idea behind it, and I agree that we must think of innovative ways to support open-source, relying on displaying an ad in a place that typically doesn't have them opens up the doors to new behavior of ad spamming when I simply want to install a dependency.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying this is the case here, but let's say that this really frustrates a percentage of developers and they decide to no longer use the project/tool/library, but the project does see an uptick in sponsorship. More than likely they'd see that as a win, and this could slowly shift the focus from a community-driven project to a sponsorship-driven project (and not as in individual sponsors, but company sponsorship). Again, I'm not saying this is the case here, but you can sort of see how that could happen if this becomes a normal practice in how we try to support open-source projects.\r\n\r\nI'd much rather see an innovative solution that tries to encourage individual community members to give more to projects they want to support rather than relying on sponsorship ads.\r\n\r\nFinally, I also agree with @mhogerheijde, when I first saw this I was confused, and my initial thought was to immediately find the package and to remove it since it wasn't clear at all where this was coming from or why an ad was in my terminal.\r\n\r\nEDIT: spelling\r\n\r\n",

Even worse, we must extract it on the disk (in case there's a build step) even if it's actually completely unnecessary (because you only print things). We've been exploring a lot of optimisations in this space lately (Yarn 2 will keep your packages within their archives by default), and this kind of pattern will prevent your users from exploiting them to full benefits.\r\n\r\n*(Note that I'm not saying the postinstall scripts are deprecated - just that they should be reserved to the use case they were designed for, which is building a package against a local environment)*\r\n\r\nFwiw, as is mentioned somewhere in this thread, Yarn already doesn't print the build logs unless they make the installs crash, so this post-install script wouldn't have any visible effect for our users. Still, I value the health of the ecosystem a lot, both from the point of view of maintainers and users, and I would be happy to discuss how we could satisfy this use case in a more integrated and less intrusive way (for example by adding a specific field to the `package.json`). I've actually opened [an issue](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues/1625) against the OpenCollective repo to discuss that, but it got no traction until now.",

At that time, adding a banner or two brought in revenue. People were clicking out of sheer novelty effect. But as it became more widespread, people started ignoring it. Then websites had to resort to more aggressive ads - animated banners, pop-ups, pop-unders. When those started getting blocked, they moved to advanced tracking.\r\nThe maintainer is getting $2000 for these banners because no one else is displaying ads there. Once other library authors notice this opportunity, they'll start adding ads too. Then the average payout comes down. But since we've already accepted ads here, some authors will include more annoying ads for slightly more money. For example, 2x the payout if the developer is required to take some action ('press enter to unpause the build) and 3x if the action is more annoying ('type out \"Linode rocks\" to unpause the build).\r\n\r\nThat's just me of course but I feel like this is not the correct direction to go towards in helping to fund open source projects and we need to continue looking for another alternative.",
