    "body": "It would be great if aside from the current way of building widgets you could add JSX like capabilities. I mean add tiny syntactic sugar to enable XML like constructs inside dart code. It just makes code so much easier to read/develop/debug/maintain and also easier for powerful GUI builders to integrate with editable code.\r\n\r\nLooking for something like DSX:\r\nhttps://spark-heroku-dsx.herokuapp.com/index.html\r\n\r\nCarlos.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe current issue with DSX is about proper integration with Flutter tools as to provide a great developer experience with debugger, auto-complete, etc. working on .dsx files.\r\n\r\nTelling users that they can use DSX but can't use debugger or enjoy auto-complete is a non starter for me. If anybody wants to help, what I need is to figure out a way to add full preprocessing support (with source map) to Dart Tools and VS Code Dart plug in. Once the tools support that DSX or any other transpiling language (any language that is a superset of Dart but compiles everything down to Dart) would just work.\r\n\r\nIf you can and would like to help, let me know.\r\n",
