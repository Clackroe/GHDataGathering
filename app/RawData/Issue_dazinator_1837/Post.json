I also tried ctrl + shift + c. Getting desperate I right clicked on the tab item itself, looking for a menu where I could select \"copy\" but no such menu seems to exist. I also tried right clicking with the text selected hoping for a menu where I could select \"copy selection\" but again no such menu exists. In desperation I gave up - copying text does not appear possible. What am I doing wrong?\r\n",
