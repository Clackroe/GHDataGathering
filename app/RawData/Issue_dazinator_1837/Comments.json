By this token the \"old Microsoft\" assertion seems unfounded and potentially disheartening for the people who have plowed a lot of work in to this.\r\n- This is a beta product, if you expect it to meet all your needs straight away you probably need to realign your expectations.\r\n- Some decisions will be made that won't work in your favour. Many won't work in my favour. However these are educated decisions made in the interest of supporting the average user (not just you), by talented devs who are acknowledging some compromise but are making pragmatic decisions nonetheless. By assuming your needs are paramount, you are potentially dismissing the needs of other users (e.g. WSL users like me who support the sensible decision to align with Gnome bindings and avoid escape sequence characters for default bindings).\r\n- This is open source. If you feel you have the expertise to override their decisions, then you are free to implement changes in your own fork. If you don't have that expertise, you can't reasonably claim that the decision taken is actually wrong. \"It's not what I'm familiar with\" is probably not a good enough justification (in my view).\r\n\r\nI won't reply to responses as I know it won't add anything and that I shouldn't have even posted the above, but I couldn't resist throwing my two cents in - sorry!",
