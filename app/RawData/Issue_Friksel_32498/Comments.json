I guess you're right. I could better just remove that old code, because I don't support IE8 anymore anyhow. And just leave ts-check for Javascript. Guess I could add a ts-check, but should always take the results with a grain of salt when using it for Javascript then. So I just leave it and already use es-lint, and that's fine with me. I just thought it would be nice to have some kind of type checking in Js, but guess if I really would like to have that I should just switch to Typescript. Which I don't want at the moment.",
