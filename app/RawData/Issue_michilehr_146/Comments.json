I'm hopeful that we'll have clarity on this by tomorrow, and at that time I'll update this PR as well as our repo's documentation.  Thanks for your contribution and continued patience.\r\n\r\nRegarding the rest of this discussion: @xyzzer is correct in that the localized files that we have published in this repo are the output of a separate localization process that happens behind the scenes, and that process is not currently structured to accept direct changes to the localized output.\r\n\r\nWhen taking Calculator open, as a team we had a decision to make with whether we'd only share the English strings (and avoid this problem entirely), or share the strings knowing that we wouldn't be able to directly accept changes to them.  We thought the community would be best served with us sharing as much as we could, and thus we have the files as part of our repo.  Now we just need to figure out the smoothest way we can merge feedback to our localized strings moving forward.\r\n\r\n@ferzkopp - According to our localization team, the language quality tab in Feedback Hub will only be displayed if the OS display language is different from `English (United States)`.",
