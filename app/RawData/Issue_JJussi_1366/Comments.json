For a simple test case, you can enter the following commands in a bash shell:\r\n\r\n    ls -la && printf \"\\e[r\\n\\e[100M\"\r\n\r\nThe `ls -la` is just to fill the screen with some content. The `printf` is generating the escape sequences to clear the margins, move down one line, and then delete 100 lines from the screen. You'll notice that it doesn't actually delete anything though.\r\n\r\nI think the same thing is happening in _joe_ when you scroll - it's moving to the second line of the screen (below the status bar) and then deleting a line to force the rest of the screen to scroll up. Since the delete doesn't work, the content doesn't scroll, and only the last line is updated.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the failure is there is a check in the `DoSrvPrivateModifyLinesImpl` function to make sure the cursor is within the bounds of the margins, but this fails when the margins are set to the full screen (that is a special case that needs to be tested separately).\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a one line fix, but I'd be happy to submit a PR for it if that would help.",

The delete doesn't just fail when the margin is fullscreen - it'll also fail any time the cursor isn't in the first column. \r\n\r\nThis is again related to the bounds check in `DoSrvPrivateModifyLinesImpl`. It's using the `Viewport::IsInBounds` method to check whether the cursor is inside the margins, but the left and right margins will always be set to 0, so that'll only work on the first column of the screen.\r\n\r\nThis is likely an issue in other places too. At the very least I can see `IsInBounds` being used with margins in the `DoSrvPrivateReverseLineFeed` method, which will cause the RI sequence (`ESC M`) to fail in similar situations.",

This would mean also updating the `DoSrvMoveCursorVertically` and `AdjustCursorPosition` methods, both of which perform similar margin tests.\r\n\r\nThat refactoring might come with a price, though. In some cases it could be a little more efficient (typically when the margins aren't set, so it can short circuit other checks), but in other cases it might be less efficient (because the absolute margin boundaries would sometimes need to be calculated in more than one place). It might not be that big a deal if the compiler can optimize it, though.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you'd like me to take this on, and you have a preference regarding the implementation, just let me know.\r\n",
