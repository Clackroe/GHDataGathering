There's probably a proper way to get this information but with my limited knowledge, I managed to hack that together.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nMy suggestion meets these guidelines:\r\n\r\n* [X] This wouldn't be a breaking change in existing TypeScript/JavaScript code\r\n* [X] This wouldn't change the runtime behavior of existing JavaScript code\r\n* [X] This could be implemented without emitting different JS based on the types of the expressions\r\n* [X] This isn't a runtime feature (e.g. library functionality, non-ECMAScript syntax with JavaScript output, etc.)\r\n* [X] This feature would agree with the rest of [TypeScript's Design Goals](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Design-Goals).\r\n\r\n",
