I forgot to add an explicit return type annotation to the generic function.\r\n\r\nThis project would take 3 seconds to build but the sub projects would take about 20-30s each.\r\n\r\nThe emitted .d.ts file for the generic function took up only 200+ lines but each line was thousands of characters long!\r\n\r\nAfter adding the explicit return type annotation, the generic function became dozens of characters long and the ~15 sub projects now take 7-10s each.\r\n\r\nTotal time saved was ~5 minutes on cold builds. So, I cut the build time in half by adding one line of code.\r\n\r\nScreenshots of the .d.ts, before and after, here,\r\nhttps://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/730",
