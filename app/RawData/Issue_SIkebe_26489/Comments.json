They stop developing identity server completely as it's not financially viable for them to continue it. \n\n2. Support and ongoing changes dry up. You have a live issue and there's no one to help you out.\n\nAlso consider the difference now : The team may have more funds to invest in making the API and docs even better, saving you time and money.\n\nIn other words, positioning this as a negative move is perhaps a little short sighted. The current situation was probably unsustainable and this was no surprise to me when I saw the news.\n\nYou have until the end of life of netcore 31 which is next year, to plan for a migration strategy. As I understand it, IS4 will continue to work, it's simply not going to be updated.\n\nI suspect that the time saving of paying the money will outweigh the cost of moving but you will undoubtedly know better.\n\n",

The framework and platform is already free to use. And you're likely making money from it.\r\n2. IdentityServer is only tangentially related to Identity management. It's an identity provider which is still a special thing you likely don't want to put into every other app.\r\n3. Identity management itself is built into the framework with ASP.NET Identity. That is completely unrelated to what IdentityServer offers though except that it integrates well into ASP.NET Identity.\r\n4. Other platforms actually often don't have solutions like IdentityServer, especially not built-in. A common alternative that I know of is Keycloak (which you can easily use for your .NET apps as well).\r\n5. There are other alternatives to building your own identity provider. In Azure, you could use Azure AD. On-premise you have ADFS. And you can also use free third-party services like Auth0 or just integrate other identity providers directly.\r\n5. If you absolutely need to ship your own identity provider, realize the complexity this involves (auth is a complex thing to master!) and consider paying for a license.\r\n6. You can also check out OpenIddict if you need an open (free) implementation. But who knows whether that will always stay free to use. ",

Let me describe our clients:\r\n\r\n1: AdminUI (which alone is $8400 / year)\r\n2: AdminUI Webhooks\r\n3: Delegation gateway 1 (https://docs.identityserver.io/en/dev/topics/extension_grants.html)\r\n4: Delegation gateway 2 (different use case, same idea.

I'd be shocked to find out that our setup was unique in the number of clients that end up being created. This client based pricing model is going to immediately price out many startups like the one I'm working with.\r\n\r\nThe IS4 authors deserve to be well compensated and I hope Duende IdentityServer is a success for their sake, but I'm also hoping they introduce something like a per-user pricing model.",
