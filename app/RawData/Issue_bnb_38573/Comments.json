The term \"Node API\" already has a straightforward meaning. Applying it to a specific API is more vague than descriptive.\r\n> \r\n> That said, I don't know that I have better ideas. (Native Bindings API? Addon API? ABI Stability API?)\r\n\r\nI'll also add that `Node API` is somewhat contrary to our years-long efforts to have the name of the runtime spelled `Node.js` and not `Node` (or `NodeJS` or a number of other variatns). \r\n\r\nOf course, now that the name change has already happened, there are significant costs/downsides to changing the name a second time in such a short period of time. I'd still support it, though, if the name was more descriptive and not subject to misinterpretation. A better name is better for our users.",
