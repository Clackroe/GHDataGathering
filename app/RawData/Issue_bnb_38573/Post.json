Please describe.**\r\nThere was recently a decision to rename N-API to Node-API. I believe this is a poor decision that will result in actively harmful results for both users of the API and general Node.js users.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, there are multiple problems with this naming:\r\n\r\n- Building APIs are a common use case for Node.js. This naming can lead to confusing information or misleading search results.\r\n- Products often refer to the way to access their services with JavaScript or Node.js as their \"JavaScript API\". If people want to use this from Node.js, there is a non-trivial chance they will look for \"Node.js API\" which will lead to confusing results.\r\n- Node.js itself has an API, which theoretically includes this API. Naming a part of the whole the same thing as the whole is immensely confusing from an education perspective.\r\n- This API is far less likely to be used than other parts of the Ndoe.js API, which leads to an exacerbation of challenge presented by the problems above.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nRename Node-API to something else.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n- Undoing Node-API rename, moving it back to N-API. \r\n  -  There is a reason a rename was done initially, and that reason is valid.\r\n- Leave it as is.\r\n  - This is going to be actively harmful to communication and education n the long-run.",
