In order to refactor multiple classes, you must send a single compilation request with all classes.  Because compilation is slow, you typically only want to compile a subset of your project (IE only files related to a refactor).  \r\n\r\nThe way existing salesforce IDE's handle this, is by allowing users to compile all open tabs.

How do you get the open editors when there's no API for it (hence this issue)?\r\n\r\n@noppa good question. When there is no official API it will be harder to implement but I believe possible. In the second comment @eamodio mentioned hack that his Restore Editors is using. When you will dig long enough sometimes you find a way.\r\n\r\nVisual Studio also doesn't have any explicit API for its internal engine that restores last opened windows and tabs. It has .suo file when it stores them but it's like black box. You could save or restore certain windows state but you have no control how it will be done at window/tab level. Because VS's last opened files engine has many flaws I wrote independent engine that ContextKeeper is using to position VS's windows and restore tabs. It works very well and allows a whole range of possibilities like opening the same mental snapshot when you switch from your desktop box to laptop without manual windows repositioning - it's detects current resolutions of connected monitors and prepare appropriate layout where all windows fit nicely to new environment. The ContextKeeper's engine allows to save mental snapshots to human-friendly diffable files so you could not only switch between different contexts easily but also track what was changed in them via git. Sharing contexts with a team opens another range of possibilities.\r\n\r\nNothing above would be possible when I would give up and tried to use broken and limited \".suo\" API. It took a lot of time but I found a way and created \"alternative\" API.",

I know that are limitations. Some of them discussed in this thread but also others like no support for floating windows in VS Code  #10121 which were always supported in VS. Workaround will be to use grid layout #14909 when you will try to open context from VS in VS Code to simulate the same windows and tabs layout (yes, opening the same context in both VS and VS Code will be possible!). I want to deliver similar experience for both VS and VS Code but knowing the limitations. ",
