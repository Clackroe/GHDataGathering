Also, it would solve the first problem **automatically**.\r\n\r\n> There's no _in_consistency here\r\n\r\nNo, there **is** inconsistency with the following naming conventions:\r\n\r\n```gdscript\r\nvar name: Name\r\nfunc name(name: Name) -> Name\r\nname is Name\r\nname as Name\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll types _except_ these three have a capitalized name. Any _exception_ is inconsistency. The only question is whether there are any advantages to having the exception.\r\n\r\n> this has not been a problem in the past 6 years for Godot users, whether experienced or beginners\r\n\r\nThis is only because this inconsistency affects only appearance, but not behavior. Just like the fact that these types are highlighted in a different color than the rest.\r\n\r\n> We can make a color for primitives a separate setting and let users decide if they want it to be the same as keywords, as classes, or have a unique color all together.\r\n\r\nSorry, but in my opinion this is useless. All types should be highlighted with the same color. Otherwise it will be too colorful: primitive types - in one color, built-in types - in another, classes - in a third, custom classes - in the fourth, 2D types - in the fifth, 3D types - in the sixth, etc.\r\n\r\n> I would ask you both: from the end user's perspective do they care whether something is a primitive type or a class type?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely agree. What does knowing whether the type is primitive or not? What is the difference between a primitive type and a non-primitive type? I could understand if types passed by value were written with a small letter, and types passed by reference with a capital letter. Or built-in types with small, and classes with capital. The only reason these three types are written with small letters is tradition, habit, and blind copying of C/C ++.\r\n\r\n> it's very common in most programming languages\r\n\r\nYes, you are right, it is, although it is absolutely pointless.\r\n\r\nBut in some languages (Kotlin, Haxe, Ada, etc) all types (even \"primitive\" ones) start with a capital letter, and this warms my perfectionist soul.\r\n\r\nBut since it does not affect behavior, this is not a change I would fight for. It's just a little annoying that people think in such fictitious categories as \u201cprimitive\u201d types. In comparison, the illogical and counter-intuitive behavior of the division operator creates much bigger problems, but people don't want to notice them and react extremely negatively due to the strength of their habits.\r\n",

It's just that `int` is highlighted like a built-in python-like function (like `len` and `str`) and this overrides the type highlighting.

It's funny that there is no difference between `str()` and `String()`, apparently `str()` was created to make GDScript look more like Python.\r\n\r\nThis is just a note, actually the problem is broader, for example `load` is always highlighted in red, even in `func load()` and `self.load`.\r\n\r\n> This is not what was suggested.

It basically just interfaces with Godot's built-in C++ classes (a limited subset, at that), with python-like syntax and a few handy shortcuts like iterating over arrays more easily.  And since GDScript does not exist outside of Godot\u2014and never will\u2014implementation details are important, since _GDScript __is__ its implementation, nothing more_.  There is nothing outside of the implementation that dictates what GDScript is supposed to be, or how it is supposed to work (the docs are only meant to describe what it is).  This is a major difference between GDScript and \"mainstream\" languages.\r\n\r\nGDScript has a lot of ties to the C++ of the engine it interacts with\u2014those \"implementation details\" being some of them.  If Godot used semicolons and braces instead of line breaks, colons and indents, would you feel the same way about this?\r\n\r\nThe real problem, though, is that any potential benefits of a change do not outweigh the obvious costs. True, there's no reason GDScript _has_ to use \"`int`\" instead of \"`Int`\", but changing it will break every current Godot coder's code and intuition with no real benefit.  One reason it may have ended up this way is that it mirrors the names of those things in C++ (what the engine devs are seeing all day), where all the types added by the engine are PascalCase, and primitive types are all lowercase.  Since the C++ functions GDScript interacts with all use the C++ built-in `bool`, `int` and `float` types, and Godot's own `Vector2`, `Variant`, `Array`, etc. types, the current situation makes GDScript code nicely mirror the same code in C++.  This isn't very useful to those who only use GDScript, but is nice for anyone also using other languages with Godot.  So I'll have to disagree with your that \"it would be nice\" to change it.\r\n\r\nIn general, I'd say the engine's syntax highlighting (and, relatedly, which things in GDScript are reserved words) is a little strange in `3.x` (why are built-in functions like `print` and `floor` reserved?), but I just did some testing, and it seems `master` doesn't really have globally reserved words (probably because of the parser rewrite).  It does, however, still have weird highlighting if for some inexplicable reason you do `var Node` or `var int` (`Node` is highlighted green and `int` red when they should be white like other variable names).",
