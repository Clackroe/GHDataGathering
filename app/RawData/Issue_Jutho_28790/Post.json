    "body": "Given that `Matrix{T}(I, (m,n))` works for rectangular matrices `m != n`, I would also expect `copyto!(A,I)` to work. I often use this to initialize an existing matrix with ones on the diagonal, even if it is rectangular.\r\n\r\nAn example is in LinearAlgebra, suppose you want to materialize the q factor in a QR decomposition. You might have two equally sized matrices `A` and `B` lying around:\r\n```julia\r\nusing LinearAlgebra\r\nQ,R = qr!(A)\r\nQmaterialized = lmul!(Q, copyto!(B,I))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll probably need to update some tests as well?",
