    "body": "This event allows the monitoring, modification, and cancellation of chat packets before they get sent to the client.\r\nAn example use case for this is in a server-side chat censorship mod - *I removed this link for a reason, do not repost it* was previously needed to ensure that all chat messages, whether sent by the player or sent by some other system which the player can control, were properly censored before being sent to the client. This event addresses that.\r\nI'm open to suggestions if anyone has any better names for anything I've added, or any other changes they'd like to be made to this event.",
