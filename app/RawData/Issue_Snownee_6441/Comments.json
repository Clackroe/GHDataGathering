As NodeProcessor is not using the mob-sensitive version, it seems I have to make a new NodeProcessor. Then implement a new PathNavigator that can create my NodeProcessor. Then replace the default PathNavigator when mob joining world. As the entity is stored in NodeProcessor (`NodeProcessor.entity`, `field_186326_b`), I think it is easier to just call the entity-sensitive version of the method. This also solves conflicts if there are mods doing the same.",
