We have a way for you to configure [default values](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/use-config-android) for RC. I assume what you are asking for is different in that you want to snapshot the config state of a client to an exported file that can be loaded into your app's distribution apk. That right?\r\nI do see that as a goal that competes directly with keeping your clients up to date with the latest config values that you have configured on the backend. Any thoughts on how you would want the clients to trade off those goals for new installations of your application? Would you rather see the values packed into your apk or the values configured on your backend?",

Happy to help with how the RC SDK works with default values!\r\n\r\nWhen the SDK starts up, it loads any default values (like the ones in the XML file). When you call one of the get methods (like [`#getString(String key)`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/remoteconfig/FirebaseRemoteConfig#getString(java.lang.String)), if a value has been fetched and activated the SDK will return that server value and otherwise return the default value for that key if one exists. Fetched values are also cached by the SDK so they'll be available (and be used over defaults) if the app has already fetched on a previous launch (and the user hasn't cleared app data).\r\n\r\nThe use case you describe where a user first opens the app without internet connection is a good case for default values since the app can use those in place of the server values.",

We support a JSON REST API since that's a common standard for REST APIs on the web, and XML defaults on Android since that's the standard for the platform.

The default values saved online and available through the REST API are the server-side defaults used when no condition is met.
