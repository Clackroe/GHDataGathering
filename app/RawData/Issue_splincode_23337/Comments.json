Currently, I'm crying out about ng-content multiple projections. And I cant nor wont argue your individual points but I do come to bring my success to the table:\r\n\r\nIt has proven well worth the pains of \"extra\" setup and the \"extra\" jumping through hoops (depending on how you look at it). In so many ways, you do have to change your approach, and your past knowledge may work against you. I'm so thankful that Angular took it's giant leaps and they make sense to me now and I wouldn't do REACT or any things else but Angular.\r\n\r\nI've now trained two people on Angular, who knew nothing of Angular before and also are Junior developers. It was and is sooooooooooooooo easy for me to stick them in Angular projects because they only have to concern themselves with the limited scope of just the small components they touch. Angular makes my life easier to work with other people, it does.\r\n\r\nSo, sorry I don't have small debate points and I don't blame you for having your point of view. However, I do see much evidence that you are trying to crash through head first through Angular and I see it as you feel it should just work the way you want it to... You also want some Angular Elements to make things easier, and you want Angular to just be easier so maybe you'll have to figure less out........... MY OPINION: it's called computer science and this job takes GREAT amounts of attention to details and great amounts of learning. A lot of reading, a lot of separating symptoms from causes, and you cant just stay junior at it....... You either consume it all OR you will be \"wingin' it\" and fighting the current of how things actually work versus how you want them to work.\r\n\r\nThat all said, I too have written \"why does Angular suck now\" entries BUT I have since edit every comment. I just about have to hold myself back from saying how much I love Angular now... You think of someone in your head that lent you a great deal of free knowledge and how humble it made you feel, and thats how I feel about Angular, they done right for all of us in the BIG choices they have made for us all.\r\n\r\nGood luck. Farewell.",

The ivy renderer in particular targets some of the pain points you mentioned.\r\n\r\nWe have two projects running in parallel, one angularjs and one angular5. And nobody here likes to touch the angularjs codebase. angular5 and the ecosystem around it is just wonderful (full template typecheck and linting, clean component interface, typescript by default, the template syntax and one way data flow). So we admire the work the team is doing with the framework. Also that there is always an upgrade path (and not a hard cut like angularjs=>angular2).\r\n\r\nMy hope is that the team gets back to productive boosting features as soon as the dirty plumbing is done. And no need for another major rewrite (Router4? \ud83d\ude31)",

While other frameworks have the same number of functional functions, and the number of libraries is increasing every day. \r\n\r\nIn Russia, I wanted to work in a large company in Yandex, but they write only on React. I wanted to work in Vkontakte, there too on React.  Large companies are opposed to the use of Angular. My friends in mid-level companies, mostly one full-stack developers, and they say that the quicker to sketch the layouts and start using Vue, without going into and diving. \r\n\r\nEspecially many front-end developers in Russia do not understand the benefits of RxJS. Allegedly they only want to use Promise.  For example, in our company, a component library is already tied to Primeng, it is badly written (if you open source), people do not even write tests. And half the time you have to kill for cutting styles. But when it is no longer possible to cut styles and is strongly tied to a component, \r\neven very difficult somehow without crutches to redefine the internal logic of the third-party component. \r\n\r\nOverall, I like Angular, I really grew up as a programmer.

Almost always there is not enough definition of URL or rout name of at the level of the directive of the type routerLinkActive. Very often there is a lack of a setValidator and a removalValidator. Very much hampered by the need for DI all and everything in the tests. There is not enough opportunity to redefine. There is not enough opportunity to override the concrete method without defining the whole class. In general, all that is needed for daily work in production. This is cool, when we have the opportunity to redefine and adjust everything to our own needs, but not when you are forced to do this in almost every new task.",

I have to say that this factor of modules architecture is absolutely fine for me and I don't feel it as limitation from any point of view. Maybe it is my personal feeling, maybe affected by my professional historical background.\r\n\r\nHere are some points as I see it:\r\n\r\n* You always have one shared module at least, usually more ... so it is a natural thing to place such a thing to a correct module. A simple app is just one module usually.\r\n* If it is something extra then it is a part of that custom eager or lazy loaded module.\r\n* There are exact rules ... and I think very simple in fact ... how modules architecture is structured. I never understand what are the reasons why some developers don't understand them.\r\n* Usually the similar discussion is about the topic ... one component / one module. The fact is that the simple module for just one component is only 5 simple lines of code ... possible to place into just one TS file.",
