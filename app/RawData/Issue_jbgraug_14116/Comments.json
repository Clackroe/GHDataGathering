It looks ugly and these high numbers quickly become meaningless. In the browser case that's the intention - forcing consumers to update to the latest version. However, for a language it's out of place and makes following new features and important changes extremely hard. Every version, no matter how big or small, looks the same way as every other. Flow has fallen in that trap and it doesn't seem to reap many benefits out of it.\r\n\r\nFor TypeScript, if you still want automatic updates without worrying too much, just lock the minor version in and everything will fall into place.",

Minor updates can add new functionality under new properties, and new properties can break existing codepaths because JS is full of do-x-if-y-property-is-present patterns. Fixing a performance bug, which would in theory be a bugfix version update, could cause two async operations which previously always resolved in one order to instead always resolve in another order.\r\n\r\nIt is simply not the case that you can safely upgrade code, with semver *as used* today by normal package maintainers, from 34.1 of some library to 34.9 and be guaranteed that your program will still behave the same way.\r\n\r\nWhat semver means *in practice* is that the major version bump is \"You will probably need to update your code in a lot of places\", and the minor version bump is \"You should always be OK for the most part\". *TypeScript never makes updates of the first kind*. We only make compat-breaking changes where we believe you should always be OK modulo a small number of fixes we think you'll be happy making (because we found new bugs).\r\n\r\nWe're not going to take a major version bump because there was a bug in the compiler where it failed to identify early errors, even though that's technically a breaking change - we think you should be \"along for the ride\" on that one if you didn't shrinkwrap.

Just be decent and follow the community's rules. Even worse, you don't seem to try to understand the other side point of view, and rush to your own conclusions.\r\n\r\n@DynConcepts \r\n\r\n> [If] the consumer cannot base their actions reliability upon [semantic versioning], then what is the value of it even being exposed to the consumer?\r\n\r\nVery easy. Just imagine a version signature which has majors only, which would be equivalent to a standardless version signature (i.e., not semantic).\r\n\r\nYou need to upgrade a library from version `234 503` to `244 503` because this last version gives compatibility to a set of target platforms you need to integrate.\r\n\r\nBut you have no idea of the **intended** breaking changes by just looking at the signature. So you have to read the changelog from `234 503` to `244 503`, have fun!\r\n\r\nQuoting from the original specification:\r\n\r\n> Without compliance to some sort of formal specification, version numbers are essentially useless for dependency management. By giving a name and clear definition to the above ideas, **it becomes easy to communicate your intentions to the users of your software**.\r\n\r\nSemantic versioning is about **communicating**, nothing more.\r\n\r\n> Yes, I agree it is about contracts, but this leads to the discussion of what exactly is a contract that provides the value necessary to truly be useful to the consumer.... In my experience there are multiple orders of magnitude between what is typically produced as a contract [by the publisher] and what is needed by the consumer to determine the impact on their usage.\r\n\r\nI am certain this is an area of improvements, and this is why semantic versioning is only at [version 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) right now! To do so, we could explore different canonical unintended breaking changes between minors that happened in software history, where the interpretation of the contract was at stake. And from there, extrapolate a taxonomy of contracts and library purity.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by library purity is close to purity in functional programming: if you only expose functions with no side effects, the library is *pure*. If your library instantiates a singleton in the global namespace, it is *unpure*. If it rely on non-javascript, environment-specific binaries, it is *environment-coupled*. But I am sure we could go way further in describing what could be called the **library footprint**.\r\n \r\nFrom that library footprint exposed to public knowledge, leveraging the impact of a library update would be easier.\r\n",

Collaborators on a project may get different versions when they install, and may get different sets of compiler errors. Fixing them for one developer may break things for another. Yes, projects should override the npm default, but they have to understand TypeScript's unusual versioning scheme in order to know to do so.\r\n\r\nEven worse, an upgrade to a new minor version of TypeScript may break users of a project. We don't have any indication through version numbers of which .d.ts files are compatible with which versions of TypeScript. A project that implicitly upgrades TypeScript to a breaking version due to breaks occurring at minor releases, builds, and publishes a new version with newer declaration files, will break consumers using an older version of TypeScript. Some users can't even choose their version due to the compiler being integrated into their build system / runtime (Angular, Storybook, TS-Node).\r\n\r\nBy adopting semver TypeScript would be a much better citizen in the npm ecosystem and reduce unintended breaks.",
