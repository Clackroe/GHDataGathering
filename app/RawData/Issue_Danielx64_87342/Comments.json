Pardon me but he dosn't distinguish between Saint Nicholas that was bishop and had totally diffrent hat and Santa Claus from popular culture who have other hat. Besides his name \"Christian\" smells like some kind of religious agitation and I think he should remove his account or be baned by highter autorities using his own argumentation preented in issue #87268 . Should I create separate issue for that?",
