At one point, my issue will be invalid because I won't even know what and how to report the bug. Already, Rouge maintainers could totally close my issue as invalid because I'm giving a way to reproduce that imply Jekyll - it would be legitimate for them to say that it's a Jekyll bug or that they want a reproducible example using only Rouge.",

Jekyll 3 introduced [hooks](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#hooks) which provide convenient access points throughout the Jekyll build pipeline whereby most needs can be fulfilled. If this is something that cannot be built as a plugin, then please provide more information about why in order to keep this issue open.\n\nThis issue will automatically be closed in two months if no further activity occurs.
