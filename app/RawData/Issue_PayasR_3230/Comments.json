We are working with the app platform team to support this requirement in a future OS release.\r\n\r\n## 2: Terminal needs the ability to launch arbitrary command-line binaries\r\n\r\nIn order for the Terminal to be useful, it needs to connect to and run arbitrary command-line binaries that _you_ want to run, like `Cmd.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`, `WSL.exe`, `ping.exe`, etc.\r\n\r\nUWP apps are not allowed to launch and connect to arbitrary binaries. Again, we are working with the app platform team to support this requirement in a future OS release.\r\n\r\n## 3: Terminal needs the ability to access files in arbitrary locations\r\n\r\nTerminal needs to be able to access files stored in locations you specify on your machine, some of which are currently unreachable by managed UWP apps.\r\n\r\n## So ...\r\n\r\nDue to these issues, it's clear why we had to build Terminal as a Win32 app for now. And thus, because the Terminal is a full-trust Win32 app (which don't offer/support granular activity-based permissions like modern apps do), the Store's permissions description is correspondingly expansive.\r\n\r\nOnce the app platform can support our requirements, and allow us to declare our specific needs (e.g. \"Run Elevated\" or \"Launch External Processes\"), we'll be able to publish the Terminal as a more restricted, and explicit modern UWP app.\r\n\r\nHowever, now that you can see the source code that implements both the Terminal, and the Console, you'll see that we do not access your camera, microphone, scan your files, etc.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any further questions.",

I'll be brief, since it's late here, but here's the gist.\r\n\r\nOur application is a full-trust application masquerading as a UWP, masquerading as a full-trust application. There's a bunch of different layers here -- we built the core components of the Terminal as though we were building a universal application to run inside the sandbox, but, as Rich alluded to, the sandbox isn't quite the right fit for something that needs the ability to spawn other applications...\r\n\r\nWe've been pushing a dependency on the team who owns the application infrastructure to make sure that we don't need this \"full trust\" moniker. It's been an interesting discussion to have here on the inside, because an application that can spawn other applications that can administer the system is only a single shade _away_ from being a full trust application. Further, it's been _fun_ (and by fun I mean, broadly speaking, frustrating) to dig through the windows application security model in search of a way to do what we need to do. :smile:",
