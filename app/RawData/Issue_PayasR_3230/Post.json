It can use any peripheral devices that are either attached or part of your device (such as cameras, microphones, or printers) without notifying you. It also has access to your location, and can use platform features, such as  location history, app diagnostics, and more, which are denied to most Store apps. You can't control most of the permissions for this app in Settings > Privacy. Note that while the app has the ability to access these resources, it might not actually do so. For more info about what the app collects or uses, review the privacy policy of the developer.\r\n\r\nCould the developers please either add a privacy policy clarifying what data does the application collect or what peripheral devices does it use and when? If no such data is collected, shouldn't the application have fewer permissions?\r\n",
