        "body": "Hi! After reading #11692 (I couldn't find it before), I still think this is not a duplicate (at least, of that issue).\r\n\r\nCurrently, you can't open _another_ menu, hovering (with or **without** holding the mouse button) over it **nor clicking while the previous one is open** (like in #15939). But this is orthogonal.\r\n\r\nWhat I suggested was not opening another menu, nested or not. Was about something you _can_ do with single clicks currently: triggering a menu option, like in the previous steps.\r\n\r\nI mean: you can't (there is no way) to:\r\n1. Open the Scene menu.\r\n2. Open its sibling, Project menu, and closing Scene menu in just one step.\r\n\r\nThis is described implicitly in #11692. He compare it with Blender - where its not necessary to hold the button to get that result.\r\n\r\nWhat I suggested was:\r\n1. **Click and hold** the mouse button over the 'Scene' main menu.\r\n2. Drag the mouse to **its son** 'New Scene'.\r\n3. **Release** the button. It won't _do stuff_ (not related with opening a menu)!\r\n\r\nWhich **it's currently possible** using simple clicks:\r\n1. **Click and release** the mouse button over the 'Scene' main menu.\r\n2. Drag the mouse to its son 'New Scene'.\r\n3. **Click and release**. It will _do stuff_ (not related with opening a menu)!\r\n\r\nBecause I considered #11692 and #15939 separated issues (even before I knew they were already submitted), I omitted additional details as \"what to do if the menu is open through clicking and holding, but the mouse is released out of the menu area?\": that would be related to those issues as that kind of things **won't work as expected even clicking and releasing the button**.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry if I expressed myself bad: I can't make a gif of the mouse button!\r\n\r\nThank you, again!",
