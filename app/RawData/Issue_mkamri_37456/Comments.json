If @mkamri can't find settings page then there must be many who might struggle a bit as well. I'm not saying they won't find the settings page. They'll eventually click on portfolio and find the settings page but it'll be \"by chance\". We need to keep things obvious.\r\n\r\nSettings is under portfolio which isn't that intuitive. Let's put \"update my settings\" on welcome or somewhere near the eyes of the user (it should be accessible from nav like legacy prod.)? \r\n\r\nSince we have shipped the beta so now we have ample of time to think of a fulll-proof solution to this. \r\ncc @ojeytonwilliams.",
