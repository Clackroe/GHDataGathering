Its actually the `set` command that is causing problems here which is why I didn't initially capture the issue.\r\n\r\nBash is setting the `$_` variable to the first arg of the previous command that was executed (see [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/280453/understand-the-meaning-of) for more info on this behavior). When you call `set`, that is getting written out to stdout. Since the previous command was a ## command, it writes out `_='##vso[task.setvariable variable=myvar]BAR'` - see [here](https://dev.azure.com/damccorm-repros/trailing-tick/_build/results?buildId=260&view=logs&j=12f1170f-54f2-53f3-20dd-22fc7dff55f9&t=f8ed7bd8-2a7f-56f6-9385-7fc29a8b5b7b&l=222) for a repro with diagnostics turned on that shows this behavior.\r\n\r\nSo this is actually the correct behavior here - I'd recommend wiping `$_` before running `set`, which I've confirmed works [here](https://dev.azure.com/damccorm-repros/trailing-tick/_build/results?buildId=262&view=logs&j=12f1170f-54f2-53f3-20dd-22fc7dff55f9)\r\n\r\n> Also, I note the potential duplicate you reference #10331 is currently closed as no fault found which does not suggest a fix is in progress.\r\n\r\nSure, probably should have been a little clearer here - right now, the system is working as designed. However, as you've seen here, this behavior is probably not desirable for all use cases. Since its not a bug, we're not going to change behavior here, but we are looking at a feature to workaround this by making some variables read only (so they can't get overwritten). You can see the spec for that feature here - https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-yaml/pull/396/files",

The contract we have with the end user is essentially: any time you write something to stdout that matches our `##vso` commands, we'll process it. That includes when tools write something to stdout, or a command writes something to stdout. We have no way of differentiating between you trying to write something and the script accidentally writing something.\r\n\r\nIMO the only potentially questionable behavior here is that we don't require the `##vso` command to be at the start of a line. I see pros and cons on that one, but that's somewhat moot at this point because we wouldn't be able to change that without risking breaking a significant portion of customers. Even with that, its not a bug as much as a design question that you _could_ disagree with.\r\n\r\nDo you think that's fair?",

Is that not clear to you?\r\n> If I invoke ##vso in a script, it behaves differently (undesirably) depending on the immediately previous command, and this is a design feature?\r\n\r\nThe issue is not that `##vso` commands are dependent on the previous line - its actually that in Bash, `set` gives you different output dependent on the previous line (since it is very intentionally dependent on the environment). Since you have an environment variable `$_` now set to `_='##vso[task.setvariable variable=myvar]BAR'`, set prints that line which invokes the `##` command a second time. So what is happening here is:\r\n\r\n```\r\necho \"##vso[task.setvariable variable=myvar]$FOO\"\r\n// The variable has been set to BAR\r\nset\r\n// The variable now gets set to BAR'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `##` commands get masked from output which makes this a little challenging to see, but if you turn on diagnostics you can see that's what is happening. That's also why your case doesn't repro if you remove the `set` command.\r\n\r\n> In other words, your demonstrated circumvention adding $_=blah before calling ##vso begs the question, well azure, maybe instead of asking customers to add this line to their scripts maybe ##vso should always do something similar under the covers?\r\n\r\nThis is mostly addressed by what I said previously in this comment, but to be clear, you'd actually want the `$_=blah` before `set` since that's the problematic command. So it would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\necho \"##vso[task.setvariable variable=myvar]$FOO\"\r\n$_=abc\r\nset\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou wouldn't need this if you were running a different command which doesn't print the environment.\r\n\r\nI would also kindly ask that we keep the conversation friendly and respectful.

If you disagree, I'd appreciate clarification on how you believe the feature is working right now and how you believe it should work.\r\n\r\nFWIW, the relevant design is as follows:\r\n\r\nAny time a `##vso` command appears in stdout it is processed - regardless of where it appears in the output. If you set a variable twice, the second time you set it wins out. `##vso` commands are wiped from the output (though you can see that they were successfully processed in diagnostic mode).",
