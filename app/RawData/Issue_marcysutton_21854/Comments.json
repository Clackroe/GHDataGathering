These are mostly for more robust source code examples that people can reference.\r\n\r\n> We'd end up duplicating the code in both written form and project form.

It lowers the barrier to entry that much more. What do you mean by \"an audit of [duplication in written code steps]\" in terms of testing code paths? I didn't quite follow. The tests I'm proposing will be based on the final output, not a branching scenario.",

For example, baseline gatsby-image functionality. \r\nIt's not an immediate concern, but in order to cover the largest amount of code snippets represented in the docs we may want to perform some sort of audit at large to determine what documents to focus on. Rather than divvying up each doc and assuming the code involved is sufficiently discrete.\r\nI may still be struggling to explain this, but it's more of a meta consideration rather than something we need to solve as part of this PR.\r\n\r\nMy main question out of this PR is how/when are we triggering the testing suite so that we can consistently confirm expected behavior?",
