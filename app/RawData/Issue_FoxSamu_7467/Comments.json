The OnlyIn transformer is a hack, and only exists for specific exceptional situations, it's not a convenience and will never be endorsed as one.\r\n* `@Mod` and `@SubscribeEvent` are API markers, they are used to identify features, it's very much not the same as what you are proposing.\r\n* IExtensibleEnum isn't an annotation? It's a hack needed by modders.\r\n\r\nTo use client-only code correctly you just need, at most, one (1) helper class, which has some forwarders and keeps all client-only references all hidden from the shared logic. You just need to follow two simple rules:\r\n1. This helper class shouldn't have any outward references to the client-only code (no client-only extends/implement, params or fields)\r\n2. The methods in this class should avoid \"implicit casts\" (eg, assigning Minecraft#player to a PlayerEntity variable), which cause the jvm to have to classload the types so it can verify they are compatible.\r\n\r\nThat's all. One class and some basic defensive coding.",
