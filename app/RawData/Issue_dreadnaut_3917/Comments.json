        "body": "This is the e-mail I sent to the Xaml folks (April 2, 2020)\r\n\r\n## Requested Themes, a saga\r\n\r\nWindows Terminal is built as an application hosting a Xaml Island, with its own Windows.UI.Xaml.Application composed subclass.\r\n\r\nTerminal *also* allows its users to select a light or a dark application theme independent of the active system theme.\r\n\r\nThe most straightforward way to do this and have it apply globally to the application is to set **Application.RequestedTheme** on startup.\r\n\r\n### Application.RequestedTheme(Dark)\r\n\r\nPer the [documentation], it is impossible to set an application\u2019s requested theme after it\u2019s been initialized. This means that Terminal will have to set RequestedTheme in its App\u2019s constructor.\r\n\r\nThis works perfectly for applications that undergo normal CoreApplication activation: the composing parent class of App is initialized, registers itself with the framework, and RequestedTheme ends up being set before initialization has completed (and it\u2019s locked out.)\r\n\r\nIn a Xaml island, however, one of two things happen:\r\n\r\n1.  The App is initialized before the Xaml Island boots up its CoreWindow/Application integration\r\n    \r\n    1.  The call to **put\\_RequestedTheme** fails with an access violation.\r\n    \r\n    2.  This causes a crash.\r\n\r\n2.  The App is initialized **after** Xaml Island startup\r\n    \r\n    1.  WindowsXamlManager creates its own FrameworkApplication\r\n    \r\n    2.  That application loads **App.xbf**\r\n    \r\n    3.  The loading of an App.xbf locks out RequestedTheme()\r\n    \r\n    4.  This causes an invalid argument HR/exception (depending on language)\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**: It is impossible to set RequestedTheme in a Xaml Islands application.\r\n\r\n## How else could we set the theme?\r\n\r\n### ElementThemes\r\n\r\nIt is possible to set an ElementTheme on the root Page of an application. This works \u201calright\u201d for Terminal, save for a couple issues ranging from minor to significant:\r\n\r\n  - Dialogs do not live under the root Page of the application; they are presented in a different visual tree by the dialog API.\r\n      - We try to set the ElementTheme on our dialogs, and this works:\r\n      - Our dialogs mostly follow the ElementTheme we requested, except their *primary buttons* and *context menus* reflect the system/application theme, which we couldn\u2019t change (#5195, #3654)\r\n\t  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/189190/100683824-f9a7ca00-332d-11eb-807a-7ab52a85cee5.png)\r\n\t  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/189190/100683856-0a584000-332e-11eb-9334-5b3959c87002.png)\r\n\t      - The primary button of the dialog is in that circle.\r\n  - Terminal implements split panes as Grids containing Borders.\r\n      - Those borders are either Accent or SystemChromeLow color.\r\n      - We\u2019re loading SystemChromeLow at runtime(1), because panes are not Xaml controls.\r\n      - It appears that we\u2019re unable to get the active ElementTheme version of SystemChromeLow because we\u2019re using the Application\u2019s resource dictionary, and that reflects the system/application theme (which we couldn\u2019t change) (#3917)\r\n\t  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/189190/100683868-117f4e00-332e-11eb-9aa5-bd9b4a955618.png)\r\n\t      - To the left of the purple line should be a white line, not a gray one\r\n\r\n1: what I wanted to ask was \u201cis it possible for me to create a brush, or otherwise get something that will change color based on the theme of the element it\u2019s placed inside, **at runtime**?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMaybe we can fix the pane one by making it a Xaml control with visual states and theme resource dictionaries? It seemed like it would be a good idea to use visual states to indicate which pane was active and let Xaml handle switching the resources off for us anyway.\r\n\r\nWe ended up writing a Xaml fragment for the Border inside the pane, giving it theme resources and visual states, and letting it go.\r\n\r\n*It turns out that a Border cannot move between visual states because you cannot call GoToState on something that isn\u2019t a Control.*\r\n\r\nWe ended up putting the Grid in the Xaml fragment containing the Border as well.\r\n\r\n*It turns out that a **Grid** cannot move between visual states because you cannot call GoToState on something that isn\u2019t a Control.*\r\n\r\nWe ended up putting a UserControl around the entire thing, because that\u2019s the only empty Control we could create, to house the Grid and the border. It\u2019s now more complex than just making the controls at runtime.\r\n\r\n*And*, after all that the issue still remains: the border has the wrong color when the application theme doesn\u2019t match the system theme.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**: This is actually impossible.\r\n\r\n[documentation]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.application.requestedtheme?view=winrt-19041\r\n\r\nThe response:\r\n\r\n> So there may in fact be no answer here now for WinUI 2/XAML Islands v1.",
