If @uncleramsay had the wrong command and it was working fine and then all they upgraded was to `3.18` wouldn't that same wrong command still work.\r\n\r\nSure it would git push when he didn't want it to, but clearly it was working before. Unless, Lerna added some better error checking and this is an error that the command specified doesn't exist and it just didn't error out before, but that's probably still a break if bad commands worked before. \r\n\r\nEDIT -\r\n\r\nRemoving the `git` in `--no-git-push` fixed the above command, but I still think it might be worth having somewhere in the release notes that bad commands will now error out instead of just being ignored.

The author of a library categorized upgrades into breaking and non-breaking. Software like renovate can then pick certain updates and apply them automatically based on this categorization.\r\n\r\n> If you're not using a lockfile, then the only one to blame for your builds breaking \"without warning\" is yourself.\r\n\r\nThe condescending attitude aside, a lockfile alone does not help here. Updating lerna necessarily means my lockfile changes. My direct usage of yargs was \"protected\" by the lockfile, because the selector `yargs@^12.0.1` still gave me 12.0.5 at `node_modules/yargs/`. But without forced hoisting (and thus forced conflict resolutions) that has no impact on what is in `node_modules/lerna/node_modules/yargs/`\r\n\r\n> not a dastardly plan on my part to cause you pain\r\n\r\nI am not saying you planned this.\r\nYour update broke something for some consumers without being SemVer major. That is unfortunate, but it's a mistake that can happen. \r\nHowever, your reaction to the mistake being brought to your intention is somewhere between condescending and hostile.\r\nYou could have said \"sorry, this was not intended, let me roll back and re-release as 4.0.0\" and it would be fine.\r\nYou could have said \"sorry, I didn't consider that the yargs API practically becomes part of the lerna API, I will make sure that future SemVer major updates of yargs only happen in SemVer major updates of lerna\"\r\nInstead you said that it's good that your mistake broke my build.\r\n",
