Now you're not gonna notice if you pass something unnecessary down the line while it's undefined. But it can unexpectedly show up when it's not undefined! Maybe in prod only (e.g. based on prod data) in an surprising way.\r\n\r\nThat's a good point.\r\n\r\n> The <Operator> use case in #13381 (comment) is the kind of API we generally discourage. It's confusing you can't insert a div or some layout component in the middle without breaking the logic. So maybe it's good that the warning adds some friction to this pattern.\r\n\r\nI tried to make the example more generic, but actually the API is more like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Sorter srortType={'asc'}>\r\n      <CheckBoxFilter sortValue={'size'} />\r\n      <div sortValue={'price'} > {price} </div>\r\n      <ButtonFilter sortValue={'color'} />\r\n      <Button sortValue={'brand'} />\r\n</Sorter>\r\n```\r\nThe Sorter component just changes their order.  I want to be able to sort the filter orders by simply passing a different value to sortType and maybe even allow sortType to be a function that will sort based on the sortValue.  The logic is maintained here if you insert any component into the middle I think, so it wouldn't be discouraged in this case, right?  Or maybe I am missing something?\r\n\r\n> That said, I don't think even for that use case that the warning is inevitable. You can write let {propForOperation, ...rest} = props inside Button and then render <button {...props} />. No need for cloneElement or cloning/deleting props.\r\n\r\nYes, you are right, I would have to wrap the <div/> in a custom component however and if Button is from a 3rd party library, I would also have to wrap it as well even if that component will do nothing else but to prevent sortValue from being spread further down.  It's a bit inconvenient and not too elegant but it works.  So I guess this would be the only downside I see.\r\n\r\n\r\n> In long term, we want to eventually make props opaque on elements. So cloneElement justification is dubious for that too. The original state use case of \"I am applying a map transformation of elements recursively\" is also not something we'd like to encourage in long term because it prevents optimizations.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, by \"opaque\" do you mean that when accessing props.children, you will not be able to access its props?  For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst MyComponent = (props) => {\r\n\r\n  const firstChild = React.Children.toArray(props.children)[0];\r\n\r\n  // Error cannot access props.foo, it is opaque\r\n  const fooPropOfFirstChild = firstChild.props.foo;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf so, I'm curious as to the reasons.  Can you point me to more information on this and the reasoning behind that goal because I see this when looking at code in various well-known projects?\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, the potential danger of the downsides (especially the first point) seems to outweigh the upsides of less wrapping.\r\n\r\n",
