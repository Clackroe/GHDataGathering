In my statically typed point of view it definitely should be an error, or at the very least a user should be able to enable a compiler option for it being an error.\r\n\r\nWe probably will have to use properly typed lenses (and forbid object spreads) to overcome this \"working as intended\" blunder, which already caused a bunch of bugs in our code which could have been caught early if the compiler would have done its job.",
