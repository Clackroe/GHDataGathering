        "body": ">     * Radar Jammer speed 85 -> 78\r\nApparently the purpose of this is that `MRJ` lag behind a blob. The change makes little difference IMO as vehicles stop and get blocked often so in a blob small differences in speed are hardly noticeable. I'm also wondering why nerfing only `MRJ` but not other support-class vehicles like `MGG`? The idea of the current setup probably was that Medium Tank and Arty would get covered by MRJ and MGG, hence the same `Mobile` speed.\r\n\r\n> Fwiw, personally I'm not too much of a fan of removing the Light Tank husk, since all other tanks leave husks, but I can see the reasoning.\r\n\r\nI understand this as a change to address #18168 for Light Tanks, make crushing more viable and improve their use as a raider unit (where getting blocked is bad). Light Tank husk removal was discussed before in #11054 (cc @Micr0Bit ) too. I personally think it's a good change after all as I would like to improve the unit's raider-role capabilities but see that removing assets and husk restore option could be a disappointment in the eyes of other players.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Tesla vision and weapon range 8c0 -> 7c0\r\nTurret vision and weapon range 7c0 -> 6c512\r\n\r\nI find this a boring change to address the problem that Tesla Coils currently feel too strong. IMO the problem is not the range but their vision advantage paired with small maintenance cost given the ability to power down structures. I would have preferred to lower only their vision so that Soviets too need to scout a frontline. Given the complaint that Telsa Coild shoot frozen actors then, if it's a problem here than there should maybe be a discussion if auto-targeting frozen actor should at all be a thing. Not a fan of converging Tesla Coil and turret range. That being said, I see the need for nerfing Tesla Coils somehow but would welcome restoring their high range if the ability to power down structures should be removed and/or changes to autotargeting frozen actors were made.\r\n\r\n:+1: to the Medium tank and Light Tank health buff and Chinook fix (their health recent health buff has lead to unintended gameplay consequences that people would use them to tank fire and rather reliably suicide into enemy infantry blobs).\r\n",

I was heavily involved with the testing of the 40 second, $2000 MCV when Omnom was doing it, and we did that right the first time.\r\n\r\n**All non-light vehicles will drop husks (Added to Minelayer, MRJ, Tesla / Chrono / MAD Tank, Phase Transport, removed from Light Tank)**\r\n\r\n>  It is being done to give some consistency for dropping husks\r\n\r\nI not only disagree with the premise but this wasn't even done right. Light tanks have heavy armor but are losing husks, APC has heavy armor but is not getting a husk, Tesla and Chrono tanks have light armor and are gaining husks. You're losing more consistency than you're gaining here.\r\n\r\n**All non-melee infantry become able to shoot out of a pillbox**: Again disagree with the consistency premise, but this isn't working right. Medics and Mechanics don't seem to work as advertised, and this completely replaces the AG rocket for the AA rocket instead of adding the AA rocket. Also #18088 isn't fixed, so we'd be adding another polish issue here.\r\n\r\n**Badger HP from 30000 to 13000**: Haven't been able to test this yet; just want to point out that we need to look at this very closely as this is more than a 50% HP nerf.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nI don't have any objections to the first list of (Bain's?) changes, but I want to remind everyone that balance changes, especially ones that change weapon range, need to be tested in singleplayer missions as well to ensure they aren't adversely affected.",

        "body": "> I again disagree with Punsho's demand for consistency for the sake of consistency, and we've had that debate with him several times on discord with no one else to my knowledge standing behind changes like $1650 for an MCV. I was heavily involved with the testing of the 40 second, $2000 MCV when Omnom was doing it, and we did that right the first time.\r\n\r\nThe only thing really that is being changed gameplay wise is the money drainage. I don't get why you're getting riled up\r\n\r\n> I not only disagree with the premise but this wasn't even done right. Light tanks have heavy armor but are losing husks, APC has heavy armor but is not getting a husk, Tesla and Chrono tanks have light armor and are gaining husks. You're losing more consistency than you're gaining here.\r\n\r\nIt is not about armour type, for example mcv has light armour and still drops a husk. The rule here is that light vehicles (ranger, light tank, mobile flak, apc, supply truck) and artillery don't drop husks. It can be argued that a unit like mrj is light but that would make the system very arbitrary and in the community when people refer to light vehicles they mean these 4",
