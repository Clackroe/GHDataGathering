In fact, this was a deliberate choice because it allows context providers to pass along data that's useful for generating contents. So, there is a purpose and on top of that we cannot break the semantics here. \r\n\r\nHowever, we can consider to exclude the fragment when comparing URIs for \"input\" equality (cc @bpasero). That would mean `foo://bar#baz` and `foo://bar#bang` would be considered to be one editor despite it causing to calls to the content provider. However, it needs careful design and thinking as such changes often cause carnage.",
