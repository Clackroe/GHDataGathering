Jekyll 3 introduced [hooks](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#hooks) which provide convenient access points throughout the Jekyll build pipeline whereby most needs can be fulfilled. If this is something that cannot be built as a plugin, then please provide more information about why in order to keep this issue open.\n\nThis issue will automatically be closed in two months if no further activity occurs. Thank you for all your contributions.\n",
