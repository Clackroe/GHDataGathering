I can create a \"test.php\" file, and the generated file will have the \".php\"-extension, all right. However, I want to use markdown for my blog posts, and these \".md\" files are automatically generated to \".html\" files! And because the posts have a .\"php\" layout with php code, but the file ends up as html, the site does not work. OK, I could create a permalink as suggested in the issue linked above, but that's a bad workaround because I don't want to hardcode the file name and directory.\r\nA similar request has been discussed already, but I find the [excuses](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/5646#issuecomment-357329996) quite weak. As of now, it's hardcoded for markdown files to be converted to html files, and that's simply not right. Give us an option here!\r\n\r\nEdit: OK, it's not really needed for other files where I can already set my custom extension manually, this would just add more confusion. But for all files which jekyll automatically converts into a hardcoded format, this should be changeable - most likely in config.yml.",
