Highlight with left+shift keyboard combo actually works, not giving characters ;2D\r\n2. Breaking from a loop using Ctrl+C does not exit Python\r\n3.

It looks like what I would need if I can run code fragments in my .py file with a shortcut (like shift+enter in terminal). So far I followed the links you provided and got to this stage \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10497301/104426631-7b705180-5582-11eb-8450-1ba1b31ff728.png)\r\n\r\nI don't know how to run code on the left with a shortcut in the interactive window though.

Add the ```# %%``` comment above a group of code you want to mark as a cell. Hit the 'Run Cell' link that appears after that.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19672699/104485477-647c3000-557f-11eb-95e4-860d376dfe19.png)\r\n\r\nActually that seems to be the only one working at the moment. There's supposed to be a command to run the current selection in the interactive window. Thanks for asking as you helped us find a bug.",
