I've read through [#6551](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/6551) and [#3345.](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/3345) I see these closed but don't see any resolution.\r\n\r\nWhat I do see is that Norton is very, very unhappy on my system with this tool. I've gotten SONAR reports about the metrics upload (and I'll also put in a vote for making metrics opt-in. I'm surprised that it is opt-out, and not terribly well documented opt-out). Norton is now saying that it needs to restart to finish cleaning out the security risks.\r\n\r\nThis is not the level of security awareness I expect Microsoft to have. Minimally fix this to be opt-in. Beyond that, work with your security teams to get the uploader qualified by at least the major vendors.",
