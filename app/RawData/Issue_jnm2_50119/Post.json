    "body": "**Version Used**: 16.8.3\r\n\r\nIf you press F12 to go to definition for `SomeMember`, and `bar` happens to be a tuple, you get taken to a source view that decompiles `ValueTuple<...>` from metadata even though I think this can't be useful and wasn't what was expected.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nFoo(bar.SomeMember);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I'm looking for is \"where is the SomeMember name coming from,\" and sometimes, \"where is the SomeMember value coming from.\" Here's an example of what I would expect:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nvar bar = GetBarFromSomewhereElse();\r\nFoo(bar.SomeMember);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect the navigation and selection to land here, even if it's in another file or in source generated from metadata, showing where the name came from. (Specifically: the name token which, if changed, would cause `bar.SomeMember` to stop compiling. In this way it's a logical extension of navigating to the definition of a member on e.g. a class.)\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n(int [|SomeMember|], int SomeOtherMember) GetBarFromSomewhereElse() => ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I go to definition on a default `ItemN` tuple element name, it's because I want to go to the place where I can create a custom name for it. (Or if in metadata, the place that shows me which library is responsible for not having defined a name.) Just like how going to definition on `SomeMember` would take me to the place where I can edit that name. In that case, I think it would be most useful to end up here:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n(int[||], int) GetBarFromSomewhereElse() => ...\r\n```",
