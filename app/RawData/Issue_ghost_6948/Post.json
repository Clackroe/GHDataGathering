    "body": ":wave: Hello everyone! Summer is coming, and so is the implementation period for Jekyll 4.0. That's right, it's time to get some breaking changes in. To accommodate for this, we're opening this issue to collect interesting ideas that people would like to see implemented in 4.0. __Keep in mind that even if an idea receives a lot of support, there's no guarantee that it'll get implemented__ \u2014 that depends on if someone is free to actually implement it. We're all volunteers here, keep that in mind.\r\n\r\nFeel free to revive old feature requests, too, just not something that we've explicitly rejected.\r\n\r\nFor an organized view of how we're consolidating ideas and features, check out our Project board: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/projects/2",
