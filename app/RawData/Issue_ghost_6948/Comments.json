I know there is [jekyll-paginate-v2 gem](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2) but it would be nice if there was a built in pagniation that worked for both post and collection items.",

One thing that has bothered me though, is that I've not been able to take advantage of the latest Jekyll features because a lot of the 3rd party CMS solutions I rely on for my clients use (cloudcannon, siteleaf and forestry) simply don't run the latest versions of Jekyll themselves. This forces me to have my folder structures in a really messy state and not take advantage of the latest features when developing locally. So if anyone at Jekyll could bend a few arms to get them to update that would be fab.",

I'll add a use case:\r\n- Create a collection of static image files\r\n- Add metadata (like alt text, captions, dimensions) in sidecar files\r\n- Loop through them to create a rich image gallery\r\n\r\nJekyll CMS services like [Siteleaf](https://siteleaf.com) could make great use of this feature. Siteleaf uploads static assets to an `_uploads` collection. cc @sskylar ",
