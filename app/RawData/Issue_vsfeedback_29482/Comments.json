The solution for mixed comments appears to be simple and unambiguous and does not require an option in the Options window.  If the second comment is a different type than the first comment, then the second comment should **never** be indented to match the first comment, thus VS should never produce the following:\r\n```\r\nint ExampleField2;  // Some comment here.\r\n                    /*\r\n                    int ExampleField3;\r\n                    int ExampleField4;\r\n                    int ExampleField5;\r\n                    */\r\n```\r\n",

Whereas, if there's this obvious gap between them, it would make it much more clear if they were intended to not be together.\r\n\r\nI agree, but that's identical to the current behavior of VS 2019, therefore it would continue to trigger bug reports.  So how about making VS only increase the indenting of a comment when it is _already_ indented further right than `int x;` ?    If a comment is currently exactly aligned with `int x;`, then why should VS think that a preexisting exact alignment is incorrect?",

However, to address the specific issue here, we would take a pull request which added a conditional formatting rule where comments already aligned where code would be indented on the same line will anchor at that location instead of the current behavior of anchoring to the trailing comment on the preceding line.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if a community member wanted to contribute such a PR, roslyn would take it.  however, absent that, the advice would be to just put in a blank line in the code.  \r\n\r\nIf this is something you are passionate about (which seem evidenced by https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/29482#issuecomment-491030328 and https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/29482#issuecomment-548212118) perhaps you would be willing to help out here with a PR yourself?  \r\n\r\nNote that there are a couple of good channels to help out people working to contribute toward roslyn (internal and external alike):\r\n\r\ngitter.im/dotnet/roslyn and\r\naka.ms/csharp-discord\r\n\r\nCheers!",

I'm one of those people and have contributed as an external community member a large number of times.\r\n\r\nAs i've already pointed out, the stated view of the team is that there is an easy workaround if hte current behavior is undesirable to you.  If that workaround is not tenable and you want to see this fixed, it will have to come from a PR from someone willing to view the change as valuable enough to invest their own time.\r\n\r\nI personally don't feel like it's worth fixing myself, but i'd be happy to help you with a PR to change if it is something that is affecting you.\r\n\r\n> The people who's job it is to improve Visual Studio's user experience \r\n\r\nAs an open source project, \"the people\" includes the community (including you, me, and other interested parties).  \r\n\r\n> would be better equipped to fix this.\r\n\r\nYes, that's likely true.  But they're also tasked with work felt to be more important and a more valuable use of their time.  And so here we are. ",
