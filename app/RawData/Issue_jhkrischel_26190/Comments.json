That probably makes the most sense for 'view'.\r\n\r\nFor 'decrypt' and especially 'edit', I'm not sure that will be sufficient. For 'edit', the re-encrypt phrase is going to need to be able to figure out which variable values originally came from a vaulted value. Especially if the file is edited significantly (reordering lines for example, or changing the variable name). \r\n\r\nSo the file presented for editing would need to include some markers indicating the text that was decrypted/should be re-encrypted. A couple of ways to do that:\r\n\r\n   1) Add comments to mark the text, and doing some text manipulation/regexes to replace it with encrypted text in place. Something like:\r\n\r\n``` yaml\r\n# START VAULT PLAINTEXT - my_var\r\nmy_var: my text goes here\r\n# END VAULT PLAINTEXT - my_var\r\nsome_plain_var: blippy\r\n```\r\n\r\n  2) Add a new yaml type indicating text to be encrypted. Something like:\r\n\r\n``` yaml\r\nmy_var: !vault-plaintext |\r\n    my text goes here\r\nsome_plain_var: blippy\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be best if we could yaml parse the input, decrypt the value, serialize the yaml to a file for editing, let user edit it, then yaml parse the results, encrypt the value, and serialize to yaml and save.\r\n\r\nBut... doing that with the available yaml parser would lose comments and ordering of maps.\r\n\r\nSo likely some in place string/text manipulations will be required.",

Replace with '!vault-plaintext vault-id' and plaintext. \r\n>         Save, open editor. \r\n>         On save/reencrypt, reparse the file with AnsibleYaml, get the\r\n>         plaintext of the to be reencrypted vaulted string, encrypt it\r\n>         (!vault-plaintext -> !vault,\r\n>          AnsibleVaultUnencryptedUnicode -> AnsibleVaultEncryptedUnicode).\r\n> \r\n>         And then, things get complicated... we can't just AnsibleYaml.dumps()\r\n>        the data structure out:\r\n>             1. Comments and comment placement is not preserved which \r\n>                 is kind of annoying\r\n>             2. AnsibleYaml can loads things into data structures\r\n>                 that it can not `dumps()` out.\r\n>                 Ie, we can't serialize a bunch of stuff we can deserialize.\r\n> \r\n>             So just AnsibleYaml.dumps'ing the datastructure back\r\n>             to a file will usually either fail or do the wrong thing.\r\n> \r\n>             #2 above is unlikely to get fixed soon if ever.\r\n>             #1 is mostly a limitiation of the PyYaml yaml module ansible uses. \r\n>                Other implementation like Rueyaml can do this, but it is unlikely for \r\n>                ansible to change this any time soon.\r\n> \r\n>         So, since we can't just serialize to yaml, we likely need to do some \r\n>         string manipulation to replace the '!vault ' blob.\r\n> \r\n>         We would need to know exactly what the before string looked like\r\n>         and where in the file it is, and what the new !vault will look like.\r\n>         But we don't really know what the new  !vault-plaintext \r\n>         string will look like.\r\n> \r\n>         For that  matter, we don't know if it will be in the same place,\r\n>         or if it will exist at all, or if it will be at the same path in the \r\n>         datastructure after the edit. \r\n> \r\n>         We could limit edit to only try to work in cases where\r\n>         those aren't changed. We also have no idea what the\r\n>         plaintext will look like.\r\n>         \r\n>        ideas:\r\n>            - !vault-plaintext is a compound yaml type, with fields for\r\n>               the vault id to use, and for the plaintext. Could also\r\n>              possibly include some identifying info for what the !vault\r\n>              it replaced looked like. An example:\r\n> \r\n>         some_var: !vault-plaintext:\r\n>                     vault_id: 'dev'\r\n>                     decrypted_from: |\r\n>                                     $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256\r\n>                                     66393964663765613335633461643334393234346231666665306635323635333137306339356232\r\n>                     plaintext: |\r\n>                                 The new plaintext to replace decrypted_from with\r\n> \r\n>         That would give vault-edit enough info to do a reliable job \r\n>         of replacing the previous content.\r\n> \r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\nThe downside to that approach is that it points out the limitations of the current !vault format. It may also be useful to extend !vault to support getting a data structure with info in it instead of just the plain text scalar. At the moment, I'm not sure if it could do both but it seems possible.\r\n\r\nOr could just call the extended info version of !vault  !vault-extended or similar.  At that point it might be possible to make !vault-extended the default vault blob format for vaulted files as well. ie, instead of\r\na vaulted file being:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256\r\n66393964663765613335633461643334393234346231666665306635323635333137306339356232\r\n3533306631646431663239623762366365663137383435380a393139303161383561303336623962\r\n35373663663036333863373666326634616532376335333133326163376136353636633763623739\r\n3736343064326662390a306438356239386665306437646665323836393032393565666136643362\r\n3663\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be yaml something like\r\n\r\n``` yaml\r\n--- \r\n- !vault-extended:\r\n    vault_id: 'dev'\r\n    cipher: AES256\r\n    encrypted_on: 2018-03-14\r\n    ciphertext: |\r\n        $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.2;AES256;dev\r\n        66393964663765613335633461643334393234346231666665306635323635333137306339356232\r\n                  \r\n```\r\n\r\nie, more or less like https://github.com/voxpupuli/hiera-eyaml",

Especially in cases where I quickly need to access an encrypted variable (e.g. a password) I really don't want to google for solutions like https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43467180/how-to-decrypt-string-with-ansible-vault-2-3-0.\r\n\r\nIt is also a problem for `git diff` use cases (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29937195/how-to-diff-ansible-vault-changes). Is improving this state still on the roadmap? I didn't find it neither for 2.5 nor 2.6...",
