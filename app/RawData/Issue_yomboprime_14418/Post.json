    "body": "This adds `transform` node attribute implementation to the SVG parser. #13478\r\n\r\n`translate`, `rotate`, `scale` and `matrix` transform types are supported, but not `skew` because of the following restriction: As there is no support to rotate elliptic arcs or complete ellipses for now, I've left those unimplemented. A `console.warn` is thrown in those cases.\r\n\r\nCircles (and ellipses) cannot be skewed but they can be scaled non uniformly in X and Y. If so, then circles can't be rotated at the same time (because they are transformed into ellipses, which never can rotate)\r\n\r\nA matrix stack is kept while parsing, to keep track of the transforms tree. Current matrix is applied in the parsing of each SVG node, and the points for the shapes are generated already transformed.\r\n\r\nFrom the various SVG files I've gathered from the main Github thread, the ones that worked before continue to work now. The ones that didn't work, some of them look better. And one looks now correct. Note that some of them doesn't look right because of the style stroke being ignored right now (some shapes are supposed to be drawn as a thick path, not as a filled shape)\r\n\r\nThis PR also solves three bugs:\r\n\r\n- m/M command's first segment is a `moveTo`, not a `LineTo`\r\n- z/Z: Solved obtaining first point in current path by remembering it (storing it) when it is relevant.\r\n - \"rect\" node: Solved missing last vertical segment (the left one)\r\n",
