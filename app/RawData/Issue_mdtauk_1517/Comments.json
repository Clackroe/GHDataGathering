(pretty much, 6 times slower that WPF - i'm using target version build 1809 - build 17783)\r\n\r\nI guess you are talking about Release build times right? The Release build is so slow because of .NET Native. It makes build times much slower, but gives you major improvements in startup times, XAML rendering (data binding) and memory usage. In Debug mode, apps should usually build pretty fast, so this does not really affect development cycles that much IMO. At least, I usually only build Release every now and then, so for me this is not a problem (I am a big fan of .NET Native performance gains).\r\n\r\n> 2. I know StorageFolder file enumeration API is not part of UWP, but that is insanely slow. The UWP sandbox (at least on Windows Desktop) is hurting more than helping.\r\n\r\nI agree that StorageFolder/StorageFile API is a major painpoint for any file driven application. I don't believe that this is caused by sandboxing, it is probably more a problem of how the API is designed. Every instance contains these properties: Attributes, DateCreated, DisplayName, DisplayType. In the old FileInfo API, these would only be retrieved on-demand on first access. But in UWP all of these properties are always retrieved as soon as an instance is created, which makes the API so much slower when you enumerate large folders. It works well if you only access files every now and then (like, open one file through file dialog). But apps that work with a lot of files and folders will have major performance hits due to the bad API design.\r\n\r\nUWP really needs a fast, light-weight file API that pretty much only wraps the file name (and maybe some file permission token). Then there should be an async method to create the \"fat\" StorageFile/StorageFolder instances from it, or open streams directly, on demand.\r\n\r\n> 3. async programming is fun, but in UWP, when an exception happens, it's somehow eaten by the UWP code, and then later break in debugger, with all the stack context lost. Sometimes, I do have the stack context inside the thrown exception itself, but not always.\r\n\r\nI have seen things like this, but I don't think that async is really the cause of these problems. Normally, exceptions from async code are handled very well. The bigger problem might be that you usually don't see any call stack from native platform code, so if the platform calls back into user code and things fail there, you sometimes don't even know why or how things have failed, where in WPF you would always see a clear stack trace of how your code was invoked.\r\n\r\n> 4. Profiling UWP code is close to impossible. Event dotTrace instantly breaks when trying to do it.\r\n\r\nDid you try with VS performance tools? They work very well for me.",

The Release build is so slow because of .NET Native.\r\n\r\nI'm talking about Debug times, **without** .Net Native. For me .Net Native generated a weird crash a while ago, and I haven't tested it since. My project in Debug x86 (it is slightly faster than Debug x64), usually takes 30-40 seconds to compile.\r\n\r\nOnce again, this is build 17783 - I have read on the internet that lower builds generate faster time - I think it's on your uservoice forum.\r\n\r\n> I agree that StorageFolder/StorageFile API is a major painpoint for any file driven application. ....UWP really needs a fast, light-weight file API that pretty much only wraps the file name (and maybe some file permission token).\r\n\r\nI couldn't agree more. Or, much simpler maybe - just allow access to System.IO for all HDD ;) That would simplify things a lot.\r\n\r\nMy app displays photos/videos from user's folders, making it easy for him/her to select his favorites to edit them to create another video - in WPF, this fast simply insanely fast. In UWP, this is beyond slow.\r\n\r\n> ... so if the platform calls back into user code and things fail there, you sometimes don't even know why or how things have failed, where in WPF you would always see a clear stack trace of how your code was invoked.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this is the issue, but it does make debugging a huge pain...\r\n\r\n> Did you try with VS performance tools? They work very well for me.\r\n\r\nI will definitely try them. I used dotTrace a low with WPF, and isolated errors insanely fast. Will definitely try the VS performance tools - just read an article about them, seems they should fit my needs.\r\n",

The first load of the visual tree or when you switch from one tab to another is not smooth.\r\n\r\n2. Something similar happens with frame cache, we have it enabled so the state of our list views is keeped when you return from it's associated form, but if the page cached has a big visual tree the navigation when you go back is not smooth and hangs for a while. Moreover we notice a performance degradation when using the frame cache and you have navigated to a big number of views.\r\n\r\nThings come worse in this scenarios if you don't have a powerfull machine or any other windows process is requiring CPU, most of our users are using i5 or i3 with 8Gb of RAM and the performance with this hardware is very bad, there is continuous hangs of several seconds on this environments\r\n\r\nHere is a sample project which try to show this two issues:\r\n[App1.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/files/3800721/App1.zip)\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "@jtorjo \r\nThe problem is that FileInfo APIs do not work well with permissions and sandboxing. If you can just create an instance from a file path, the system cannot know if/how you got access to that file. So I think a new file API is required, but one that is optimized for performance. One that does not query lots of data, when all you need is the plain folder+file names.\r\n\r\nIf you want good file performance, there is one thing you should be aware of: Enumerating files usually involves lots of async calls. Every single \"await\" on the UI thread is very slow and will cost you about 10ms. This is just the \"await\", with no actual work being done. So for bigger file operations, it is highly recommended to not await every single async call on the UI thread. You can do that by adding ConfigureAwait(false) on every async method call, or by running the whole file IO stuff on a background thread. I use the latter, since it is easier to implement:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// read files on background thread and await result only once on UI thread\r\nvar files = await Task.Run(() => ScanFilesAsync());\r\n\r\n// now work with files on UI thread\r\nShowFiles(files)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow all the countless await calls inside ReadFilesAsync will not be awaited on the UI thread but on the background thread (which is very fast). Only the final result is awaited once on the UI thread, and then it can be used on UI tread and for data binding. Be careful to not access UI stuff in ScanFilesAsync().\r\n\r\nThe same concept is useful for other complex file or stream operations, like reading or writing stuff in a loop, where you have lots of await calls. Put that in a background task or use ConfigureAwait(false) and you will have much better performance, close to classic .NET APIs.",

(no building at all). On 1809, deploment was less than 1 second.\r\n\r\nHere are a few other notes:\r\n- if I have a project, say edit_ui, and another project depends on it, say test_ui. If I modify anything in the xaml part of edit_ui, I will need to recompile test_ui, or otherwise, I can get exceptions (if I modify something in the implementation, that is not needed). In my mind, this should not happen.\r\n- sometimes some projects get recompiled even if I haven't done anything (can't repro consistently)\r\n- compilation times are very very slow, and I don't see anything as \"incremental build\". In other words, my main UI project takes roughly 10-15 seconds to compile. If I modify basically nothing (I just type an Enter, in a .cs class file), it will take the same amount of time.\r\n- I don't understand why xaml files get recompiled even if I haven't touched them\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Clearly, a lot can be done to improve performance.  Why is WPF now faster?  Why have we not seen any performance gains in UWP of late?  Why is WinUI so very slow?\r\n\r\nDespite the .Net Native compiler being slow, I'm still a big fan.  With a rational code segregation scheme when designing a larger app, it's possible to greatly diminish the pain of a rebuild for release.  So for those experiencing lengthy rebuilds, you probably need a better understanding of your apps dependency tree in order to fix your rebuild issue.  .Net Native is surprisingly good at this stage.\r\n\r\nEverything but UI should live in .Net Standard libs.  Take a look here for how this helps: https://github.com/Noemata/FakePOS",

I opted to remove one part out of the benchmark, and that's raw compute, since it's not a fair comparison.  .Net Native still outpaces .Net 5.x when compiled for release.  So the performance picture is more complicated than can be gleaned by looking at the surface details.  Not sure what all the tweaks consisted of (jitter, libs, etc.), but .Net 5.x + WPF is more than the sum of its parts.  It's also quite impressive how the .Net team managed to maintain stability throughout the different releases.\r\n\r\nGiven that most of the benchmark is happening at the rendering layer which is mostly driven by machine code (shoud be seeing way more GPU activity), I would expect UWP to be fastest.  Clearly, UWP has not gotten as much attention lately.  The .Net Native compiler has received some needed tweaks of late and is looking pretty good.  It's not flawed as much as it is limited to constraints that require careful design choices when using reflection.  It's a shame it's not being progressed further.\r\n\r\nFingers crossed that WinUI will some day reach WPF+.Net 5 level of stability.  Microsoft will need to re-invest in UWP.  At least until they come up with a better alternative to CsWinRT.",

[Install ADK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install).  You only need Windows Performance Toolkit option to be selected.\r\n    * For more [details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-recorder).\r\n2. Execute `wprui.exe` (Windows Performance Recorder UI).\r\n3. Click on `More options` to reveal recording profiles and then select the following:\r\n    * For CPU trace:\r\n      * `First level triage`\r\n      * `CPU usage`\r\n      * `Disk I/O activity`\r\n      * `XAML activity`\r\n    * For memory usage trace:\r\n      * `First level triage`\r\n      * `Heap usage`\r\n      * `VirtualAlloc usage`\r\n      * `Reference Set analysis`\r\n      * `XAML activity`\r\n4. Click on `Start`.\r\n5. Run your scenario.\r\n6. Click `Save` and follow the prompts.  If you'd like to look at the trace right away, after it's saved click on `Open in WPA`.\r\n7. WPA is a great tool for analyzing traces.  For intro on how to use it take a look [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-analyzer).\r\n\r\n@bartekk8 as FYI.",

Performance tooling can be used to evaluate perf, but first you need a well constructed test scenario that touches the areas of interest in a way that doesn't skew results.  Initially, I was only looking to evaluate basic XAML rendering times for WPF/UWP/WinUI; XAML primitives only.  I'll leave it to experts like yourself to do the nuanced analysis.  I'm only looking for big picture real world applicable results.\r\n\r\nHere's another example of a tool I put together to do LOB related sorts of testing: https://github.com/Noemata/RosettaNavigation\r\n\r\nI'm more interested in the performance/validation suites Microsoft uses.  I find those more telling because I can see the API surface being traversed during the test.  API interactions are often quite surprising.",
