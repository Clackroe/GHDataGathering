I want to ask you to try to reproduce it, so we get more info from it.\r\n\r\nIn order to reproduce it, close Code, open the `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft VS Code\\resources\\app\\product.json` and change the `commit` field to `outdated`. Start Code, you should get an update flow. If the issue reproduces and you get the dialog which asks you to send us the log file, please do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Open [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/)\r\n2. Enable the `Elevation`, `Integrity` and `Command line` columns in Process Hacker\r\n3. Search for any `Code.exe` processes running. If they are running, copy the full command line of each and show me.\r\n4. Check what is the elevation and integrity of the `inno_updater.exe`, does it match its parent?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help here, looking forward to learn more about this and fixing it!",
