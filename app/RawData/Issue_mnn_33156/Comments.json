Most likely, the magic performed by Godot to replace built-in by their actual value also replaces it in the function where they have been declared as arguments. In your case, this function is outside `fragment()` and used `TEXTURE` which is fragment-only, so it breaks. Same bug, just different manifestation.\r\n\r\n> Kinda glad I will be leaving Godot, this \"duplicate\" labeling feels as lazy as on stackoverflow...\r\n\r\nThat's petty, but well.
