Snapchat invented Stories but the paradigm of ephemeral updates has since been adopted by Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and most recently, Spotify. There is even a VS Code extension that adds this feature. \r\n\r\nWhy should LinkedIn get all the fun?! Windows Terminal might be a singular experience (but with user profiles, is it really), but that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t create an ephemeral social layer into it. \r\n\r\nWindows Terminal \u201cStories\u201d could be in gist form (a la GitHub) or scripts in your favorite shell language (PWSH or BASH or ZSH, in da clurb we all fam), they could also be print screens of your current terminal session. Because who doesn\u2019t want to show off their latest Neofetch/winfetch ASCII art! \r\n\r\nAs a longterm goal, there could even be a way to share a gist/link to your config file to share your specific terminal preferences and font/color information. \r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\nIn order to see Stories from others (assuming we don\u2019t want to focus just on local users), we would need to run some sort of web server that ties into some type of social network for followers/displays. GitHub would probably be ideal for that. \r\n\r\nHaving said all this, as good of a feature as I believe Stories would be, it would probably require a lot of resources and overhead, not to mention possible performance concerns. Perhaps this is a better request for Hyper, since it is Electron and basically running a web browser anyway. (No shade to Hyper \u2014 Hyper is great and beautiful and I\u2019m just teasing out of love!)\r\n\r\nIn fact, the more I write about this. Maybe it\u2019s a bad idea. \r\n",
