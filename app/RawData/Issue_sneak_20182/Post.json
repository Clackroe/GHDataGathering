Launch Atom for the first time\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nNo telemetry is sent.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nTelemetry is sent.\r\n\r\nAtom transmits my IP address (and implicit timestamp) to the manufacturer and thousands of other people.\r\n\r\nAt no point am I prompted for consent prior to this happening.  This happens *silently*.\r\n\r\nOnly **after** this information has been sent out of my machine does the main application window open with the consent dialog (which has its own issues).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"548\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-11-26 at 10 22 52\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/408977/69661425-395f1600-1037-11ea-9cfd-64f6959d4f60.png\">\r\n<img width=\"577\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-11-26 at 10 22 56\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/408977/69661427-395f1600-1037-11ea-9246-c93edb428562.png\">\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**  100% of the time on first launch\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n1.41.0 x64 osx\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nA user's IP address, as well as the tracking/telemetry/analytics/autoupdate target host IP are both transmitted from the user's machine at time of first launch (adding a timestamp to these first two pieces of data).\r\n\r\nThis tuple of (user source IP, atom.io destination ip, TCP port, TLS SNI hostname, timestamp) **leaks usage information** to thousands of different people when it is sent from the user's computer: ISP, hosting providers, network interchanges, intelligence services (hi Ed!), Microsoft internal systems administrators, GitHub systems administrators, and Amazon network administrators.  The user is given **no opportunity** to opt out of this, to prevent it, and is **not even made aware of it happening**.\r\n\r\nThis means that the work on #12281 is *incomplete*.  The software is still **transmitting user data without consent** before the consent dialog even appears.\r\n\r\nWikipedia defines spyware as:\r\n\r\n> Spyware is a software that aims to gather information about a person or organization, sometimes without their knowledge, and send such information to another entity without the consumer's consent. \r\n\r\n## Required Elements\r\n\r\n1. software :white_check_mark: atom is software\r\n1. *gathers information about a person* :white_check_mark: information that the user is launching Atom for the first time\r\n1. *without their knowledge* :white_check_mark: no information is displayed to the user when the request is made, or any time thereafter\r\n1. *send information to another entity* :white_check_mark: sends data to ISP, routers, hosting companies and staff, GitHub, Microsoft, Amazon, and NSA\r\n1. *without the user's consent* :white_check_mark: no consent was asked or provided, and indeed, did not exist\r\n\r\nPresently, Atom does *all of these* on first launch.",
