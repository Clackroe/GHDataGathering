That's *why the consent dialog exists*.\r\n\r\nVery obviously this is a bug: the auto-update mechanism, which is itself a form of telemetry so long as it uses the network (transmitting to the manufacturer that the user has installed Atom), must be serialized to occur *only after* their consent (or lack thereof) to telemetry is indicated.  Doing it beforehand renders the telemetry opt-out entirely ineffective, as you *still end up sending telemetry* to the \"what version is current\" service, even when the user doesn't want it sent.\r\n\r\nThat seems to be a recurring issue, as well: #20185 elaborates on that.",

There's clearly a reason Atom's team believes auto-updates on by default is of high importance. Imploring maintainers of an open source software is not going to yield the best results, I think.

It appears that the core idea being asserted is that making any network connection is, in essence, sharing private information with whomever might have access to sniffing the network at any point between the source and the destination. Secondarily, that Atom has a responsibility to prevent any network access that the user doesn't explicitly grant consent to.\r\n\r\nWhether we agree on the first point or not, the way that Atom is designed, it _cannot_ prevent all network access in all circumstances. If you install a package that opens a network connection, there's nothing that the core Atom code can do currently to prevent that and that ability isn't something that the Atom maintainer team is going to spend time investigating or implementing. So, if you want an editor that will work completely offline with no network connections whatsoever, Atom is not going to be the appropriate editor for you.\r\n\r\nWe agree that the telemetry package shouldn't send information before a button is clicked, so we're definitely going to investigate premature connections to `central.github.com` before the user has explicitly clicked a button and we are tracking that in https://github.com/atom/telemetry/issues/33.\r\n\r\nWe can appreciate that different people make different tradeoffs when it comes to network exposure versus functionality. We've made choices that we feel strike a good balance for the majority of users, so we'll be leaving the rest, specifically auto-update checking, the way it currently is designed.",
