This could be just a failure of documentation, as the rotation sequence is not apparent.  But I have a long-term objective that would be served by a more general solution than just puzzling out which Euler sequence is in current use.  Maybe a more general solution would be of use to others as well.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nUsing a mesh instance with geometry that makes rotations traceable (I used a 1:4:9 brick), I experimented with rotations, trying to discern whether the rotation sequence was a \"Body\" (intrinsic)\r\nsequence or a \"Space\" (extrinsic) one, and what order the rotations were done in.\r\n\r\nRotating 90 deg about Z, then 90 deg about Y, then 90 deg about X, the last rotation was neither about Body X nor Space X.\r\n\r\nRotating 90 deg about X, then 90 deg about Y, then 90 deg about Z, the second rotation looked like a Space rotation, and the third looked like a Body rotation.\r\n\r\nI conclude that the rotation sequence used is not ZYX nor XYZ.  It is not apparent from the inspector nor the Transform class documentation what sequence is used.  Rather than go through all possible sequences to find the one being used, I would like to contribute code to use any sequence desired by the user.\r\n\r\nI am new to Godot.  I would like to use it as a rendering engine for a long-standing simulation project of mine.  It would improve my workflow if I could explicitly choose the rotation sequence in the Inspector and (probably) also in GDscript.  The attachment [DCMsForGodot.txt](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/2108170/DCMsForGodot.txt) is a set of C routines for converting from Euler angles (all Body-3 and Body-2 sequences) to direction cosine matrices (DCMs) and back, and also from DCMs to quaternions and back.   Would anyone like to adapt and incorporate them?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-Eric\r\n",
