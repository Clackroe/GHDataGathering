Having a full set of Euler sequence options would help me handle other conventions for \"up\", of which there are a few. ;-)\r\n\r\nI have gathered that y'all aren't keen on Euler angles.  I heartily agree that they have their limits.  But I do use them regularly for user input/output (and gimballed joints).  Being able to see and set the sequence in the inspector would give me flexibility that I promise(!) I would use.\r\n\r\nA more modest proposal, whether or not you care to adopt multiple Euler sequences.  As it stands, *the* sequence is YXZ, but in the inspector the angles are laid out in XYZ order.  Were they labeled in YXZ order, I reckon I'd have figured out the Euler sequence on my own.  And if you do adopt all the sequences as I propose, then it is important to point out to the user that the three angles are listed in order of rotation, not in XYZ order.  The \"Body-2\" (aka proper Euler) sequences only use two axes anyway, like XYX or ZXZ.",

That used to be a limitation of the inspector, because the 3 Euler angles are conveniently stored using a `Vector3`, and the way it appears in the inspected was fixed for all vectors. But @reduz recently overhauled the [inspector](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-gets-new-inspector) and AFAIK it should allow reordering the fields appropriately, and furthermore should allow for things like\r\n\r\n> The \"Body-2\" (aka proper Euler) sequences only use two axes anyway, like XYX or ZXZ.\r\n\r\n(I'm not familiar with avionics jargon BTW, I'm a physicist --never knew you guys call it a \"proper\" Euler sequence when there are 3-axes and two of them coincide)\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be against having all possible sequences involving all \"named\" axes of X, Y, Z in the API, and let users choose different conventions in the UI (like in Blender), but I virtually have 0 weight on what gets merged/rejected. Maybe project owners can chime in and tell us what they think?",
