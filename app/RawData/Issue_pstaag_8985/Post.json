Use the category \"Apps > Windows Terminal (Preview)\" and choose \"Share My Feedback\" after submission to get the link.\r\n\r\nPlease use this form and describe your issue, concisely but precisely, with as much detail as possible.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Environment\r\n\r\n```none\r\nWindows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19042.746]\r\nWindows Terminal version (if applicable): 1.5.10271.0\r\n\r\nAny other software?\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Right click on an open Tab\r\n2. Move the mouse cursor slowly downward from the first menu entry down to the last.\r\n3. Move the mouse cursor slowly upward again from the last menu entry up to the first.\r\n4. Move the mouse cursor *faster* downward from the first menu entry down to the last.\r\n5. Move the mouse cursor *faster* upward again from the last menu entry up to the first.\r\n(step 4 and 5 may need to be repeated a few times.)\r\n6. Boom. Crash.\r\n\r\nWhat you want to achieve, I think, is that you want the *Close...* submenu to be rendered once, and removed again. And after that, you want the mouse pointer to trigger the Ux-thing that once again renders the menu while you move the cursor fast enough that it's actually not rendered because the mouse cursor has already passed the *Close...* menu option.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- A description of how to trigger this bug. -->\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n<!-- A description of what you're expecting, possibly containing screenshots or reference material. -->\r\n\r\nNormal menu rendering without a crash.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nPossible to crash the app by moving the mouse cursor up and down above the menu.\r\n\r\n<!-- What's actually happening? -->\r\n",
