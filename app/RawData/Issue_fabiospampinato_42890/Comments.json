Since we now have URL handlers for Mac and Windows, those instructions became almost irrelevant. We now only show them for Linux users:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22350/35850126-1510cbaa-0b24-11e8-88da-f21d798b53b3.png)\r\n\r\nRunning this in VS Code will correctly trigger the search for `@id.name`. The `name` format should've never been there. Only the`id.name` is unequivocal in order to find an extension in the Marketplace.\r\n\r\nOne idea I have for alleviating this pain is to improve the `ext install name` (without `id`) experience: what if we showed in quick open a list of extensions which match that name? This would simply mitigate the fact that there are instructions for `ext install name` out there. But in any case, I recommend switching your instructions to `ext install id.name`.\r\n\r\nWe've notified the Marketplace of the search issues.",

Among the string matching, exact string matches carry a higher weight than prefix match. \r\n\r\nSince `node_modules` is one word in your extension name, word `node` in search text gets prefix match here. However, there are lot of extensions on Marketplace which have exact word 'node' in their extension name. So they carry a higher weight for matching the word 'node'. Additionally, since your extension is new, download count and ratings of other extensions are way higher, pushing their total score to the top.\r\n\r\nOne way to improve your extension rank is to break word `node_modules` into separate words `node modules`.
