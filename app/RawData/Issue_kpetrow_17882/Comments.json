These are very large surface models.\r\n\r\n@Mugen87 I do not think that is true because the issue is not seen in r103.  There was a change in the code base that introduced this bug.  If it never worked, then i would agree it is a  webGL/GPU issue, but it was working up to r103 and we have it in production at r92 for a pretty long time(since r92 release)",

Light probe is part of ambient light so removing ambient light fixes the issue. \r\n2. light probe is a measure of ambient light not a child.  So no ambient light no light probe?\r\n3. Hemisphere lighting does not show flicker\r\n4. Hemisphere white light is super flickery\r\n5.  Looks like the more white the light the worse the flicker, equally bad on hemisphere and ambient.",
