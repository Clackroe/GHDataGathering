However, whenever I attempt to ping or connect to the machine I get the following errors:\r\n\r\n[WARNING]: Unable to parse /etc/ansible/hosts as an inventory source\r\n\r\n [WARNING]: No inventory was parsed, only implicit localhost is available\r\n\r\n [WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'\r\n\r\nCan someone let me know how to fix this problem please.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nCarlotn",
