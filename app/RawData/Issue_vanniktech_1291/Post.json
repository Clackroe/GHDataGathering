    "body": "In the given repository - https://github.com/trello/navi there are different tags. The old tags follow the x.y.z convention. Currently the latest one there being displayed with refined github is 0.2.2. \r\n\r\nHowever there's a newer version 2.0 as well as 1.0. From a user perspective even though the versioning might not be consistent I'd expect to get 2.0 displayed as the current tag.\r\n\r\nI understand that [semver](https://github.com/npm/node-semver) is used in refined github. Is there another API that we can use to fix this behavior or should this get reported to semver?",
