If the active position is at the bottom margin, a scroll up is performed.\r\n\r\nBut instead of moving down a line, it moved left. Example test case:\r\n\r\n    printf \"  x\\033D\\033D\\033Dy\\n\"\r\n\r\nIn a Windows 10 bash console, this produces the following output:\r\n\r\n    y x\r\n\r\nIn a Linux console it works as expected:\r\n\r\n      x\r\n      \r\n      \r\n       y\r\n\r\nI assume this is because the sequence is being interpreted as a VT52 _cursor left_ command, but typically those VT52 sequences would only be active on a VT100 compatible terminal when the DECANM mode had been set to VT52, if at all.\r\n\r\n* What's wrong / what should be happening instead:\r\n\r\nI would expect the `ESC D` sequence to be interpreted as a VT100 _index_ command, and not a VT52 _cursor left_ command.\r\n\r\nI understand that not every VT100 sequence is going to be supported, but when that is the case, I would expect the sequence to be ignored completely. And to avoid conflicts like this, I think it would be preferable if any supported VT52 sequences were only active when the VT52 compatibility mode was actually enabled.",
