For example here we'd need a setting for VT100 and another setting for VT52. Choosing the VT would load the behavior associated to it and fall back to what conhost considers default in whatever behavior implementations haven't yet been implemented for a particular VT sequence.

Also, I did put the caveat \"default to...\" because of course we'd all be skeletons by the time every term level was fully supported. \r\n\r\nI know you guys are trying to make the console look like xterm but it may be easier trying to reproduce a project like [eterm](https://github.com/mej/Eterm) or [LXTerminal](https://wiki.lxde.org/en/LXTerminal) which are xtermish but with less code than xterm proper.",
