    "body": "Currently IPython uses `~/.ipython` which just clutters people's home directories and makes things like backing up configuration files much more hassle than it should be. \r\n\r\nThis was last discussed more than five years ago and should be discussed again. Points made at that point in time frankly, don't really hold up. It is more consistent to follow platform specs, people learn where to look first. Secondly, for support reasons, you don't really have to ask what platform they're on, just mention the three paths in one sentence, it's actually rather easy. ",
