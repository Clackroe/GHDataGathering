Neither would the updating even be necessary, the official documentation should contain the location of the configuration file, that's it. The third silly thing is that you're acting like IPython doesn't have any changes that break some pieces of code or tutorials out there. All in all it makes your comment seem more like irrational stubbornness than actual concerns.\r\n\r\nNot to mention, if it's _that_ hard to change the folder, then that hardcoding seems like a massive code smell anyways and should be fixed anyways, and the choice to set the location of the folder should be up to the user.",
