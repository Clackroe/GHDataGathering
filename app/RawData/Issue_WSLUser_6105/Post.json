It's the small things that can make such a huge difference.\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\nAdd the background images to `defaults.json` for each distro profile. We should start with the ones in the Store like Ubuntu but we should accept community contributions for other distros that are custom imported as well such as Clear Linux.\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\n-->\r\nI'd like to see background automatically set to the image stored locally on the computer to each distro profile so if I open a distro, I'll see that background by default. Users can still override it in `settings.json`.",
