That make no sense, why you make efforts to a open source, because you love it. when you love it, why not keep it the best. \n@lee-dohm, Then about the purpose, 200M, 100M? @crquan already gives us a good example ###sublime###. your words looks so ridiculous too, I have to say. no offence.

Something like binary, dev, and src packages? Because it is losing its original grace, and if this keeps up, I may have to switch.",
