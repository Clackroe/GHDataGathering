Method `ngOnInit()` is not launched too, its lauched only after any interaction with a component (form input, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nChange Detection is working with asynchronous route change.\r\n\r\n## Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions\r\nSample:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-tqcthi\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nAngular version: 6.0.3\r\n<!-- Check whether this is still an issue in the most recent Angular version -->\r\n\r\n## Browser:\r\n- [*] Chrome (desktop) version LATEST\r\n \r\n## For Tooling issues:\r\n- Node version: XX  <!-- run `v8.11.1` -->\r\n- Platform:  Windows\r\n\r\n## Others:\r\ntypescript: 2.8.1\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\nIt's working if Observable from `this.auth.logIn()` convert to a promise, like this:\r\n```typescript\r\nthis.auth.logIn() // returns Promise\r\n     .then((result) => {\r\n                this.router.navigateByUrl('myApp');\r\n            }).catch((error) => {\r\n                this.router.navigateByUrl('login');\r\n            });\r\n```\r\nBut I don't want to use promises, I want to use the Observable! Why It's not working? >:E There is no objective reasons for that. ",
