        "body": "@SinSeitan I def understand how frustrated you are, but every new platform has its shares of issues and stability.  Yeah, there's been issues from the manufacturer, all the way through to the middle ware game engine, and even here in the community trying to solve the problems. (odd thing is that's what keeps me around \ud83d\ude05 ).\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind this is a Gen1 device, that was never really intended to go beyond developers who wanted to play with it, and companies wanting to do a feasibility test.\r\n\r\n> The only way to grow and learn is to make mistakes, the important thing is that you learn from them.\r\n\r\nThis quote couldn't be any more true, especially when it comes to software. The nice thing is that it's a continuous process to grow and learn, and they only way you really know that it's happening is when you make mistakes.  I'm glad to see the software getting better (and it has!).  Microsoft, Unity, and even the Toolkit have come a long way in the last two years.\r\n\r\n> I'm just sick of having to go through thousands of tutorials, forums, chats, emails and so on.\r\n\r\nI agree it is a pain, but I think the difference here is that you haven't talked to me, or other engineers trying to make your life easier by fixing some of the problems. This is the first time I've heard from you, so **let's open a new issue and try to figure out what's going on**.

I understand you're frustrated, but having a positive attitude, even when you're stressed out or frustrated speaks volumes to others who are genuinely trying to help.",
