        "body": "I disagree with this feature request.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I tilted my head in confusion when I read \"ugly racial slur\", because none came to mind. Took me a couple of seconds of staring at `ng-repeat` to understand what you mean. I think that the girl was in a vast minority of people who would interpret `ng-repeat` as [the word I assume you're referring to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger). In fact, I find it fascinating that someone at an Angular workshop was confused. Did the girl really not notice the pattern of `ng-app`-`ng-init`-`ng-model`-`ng-if` leading to `ng-repeat`? Furthermore, I am amazed by how you, as the teacher, managed to avoiding pronouncing _any_ of the directives as \"en-gee\" during the whole workshop.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a question on StackOverflow asking for the etymology of the `ng-` prefix is by no means \"evidence that it is a confusing name\". Being curious about an official origin doesn't mean you're confused.\r\n\r\nReplacing the directive would not make the project more \"inclusive\". There are several definitions for this word, but I will assume that you meant this one: \"not excluding any section of society or any party involved in something\" (please correct me if my assumption was incorrect). The project is already as inclusive as it gets: _everyone_ is welcome to use it and participate in its evolution by contributing, pointing out bugs, asking questions and helping others. Changing `ng-` to `ang-` would not affect this fact, positively or negatively. \r\n\r\nAlso, it would certainly not be \"easier to remember\" because that would mean changing every existing material online. It would be a huge breaking change and I'm sure that a huge portion of developers would be outraged. Angular already had one issue with renaming few years ago, which brings me to the following point: `ng-repeat` is not an Angular directive. It comes from a different framework called AngularJS, so this issue is opened in a wrong place. Angular uses `ngFor`.",

We the Angular team, strongly believe in building an inclusive community where everyone feels welcome, and we see how especially ng-repeat could be problematic in certain scenarios. It was never our intention. \r\n\r\n\"ng\" simply stands for a*NG*ular - the two characters in the middle of the name. And the name Angular has its roots in angle brackets that are the key part of HTML syntax that Angular uses.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the current names of APIs that are prefixed with ng we concluded that ng-repeat was the only one that stood out as potentially problematic. Fortunately, the latest versions of Angular use [ngFor](https://angular.io/api/common/NgForOf) instead of  ng-repeat. ng-repeat is no longer used by Angular and was deprecated along with AngularJS a few years ago, so this api is no longer used in new development.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, we will not make any changes in our current APIs, but we will be very mindful of this problem when creating future APIs. Thank you for bringing it to our attention.",
