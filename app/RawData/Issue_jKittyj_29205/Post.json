    "body": "# \ud83d\ude80 feature request\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI led a workshop on web development for the youth. A girl asked me a question what a certain line on an angular template meant. She was unusually shy and had trouble pointing at the line. Later she said in private that she didn't know how to read ng-repeat out loud. Spelling it reminded her of an ugly racial slur. I understand that it is just an unfortunate abbreviation, but it limits the pool of the talented folks who could learn angular.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nReplacing the ng with ang or something similar would be awesome. It will make the project more inclusive. It also matches the library name better, so it's easier to remember. There is evidence that it is a confusing name https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14669322/what-does-the-ng-stand-for-in-angular-js-directives\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nThis is a big change. We could start it by improving documentation and accepting two prefixes by default.\r\n",
