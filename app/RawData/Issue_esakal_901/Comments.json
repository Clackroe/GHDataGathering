Especially nowadays with ES module exports and whatnot combined with tree-shaking module bundlers, there\u2019s really no fundamental _necessity_ for false-basedir publishing.\n\nLerna is designed around the way npm works. Packages are published from the same directory as the package.json, and construct their tarball from metadata contained therein.

This is handled in a gulp file but I've simplified below.\r\n  - The `package.json` version has been bumped prior to the `postversion` script being called\r\n  - `postversion` is only called if you do not include the `--skip-git` command to lerna publish\r\n  - `\"postversion\": \"cp package.json dist && npm publish dist\"`\r\n\r\nI still think a config option for `npmDistDirectory` could be beneficial since it would allow a consumer to leverage the `prepublish` lifecycle-hook which seems a little more intuitive.",
