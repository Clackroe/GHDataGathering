    "body": "This option was added in PR #46895 where the default in the `run_file` function was set to `True`, but in the `run` function it was set to `False`. This is an error and the default should be `True`.\r\n\r\nWith the default set to False, it causes a test failure and would also be a change in behavior from previous releases. In addition, the docs also say that default is True. Therefore, this looks to be a typo. This PR sets the default to `True`.\r\n\r\nFixes the following test failure:\r\n\r\n- unit.states.test_mysql_query.MysqlQueryTestCase.test_run\r\n",
