They will grow up feeling detached, they will have deep rooted trust issues, and they will have an inability to feel empathy. The actions of ICE have had a lasting lifelong impact on these children, and many of them won't even remember it happening.\r\n\r\nI have trouble expressing how angry this makes me feel.\r\n\r\nAnd the worst part is that I feel helpless to improve the situation. I vote, I campaign, I phone bank, I donate, I protest, I write to officials, I try to inform others... and yet things just keep getting worse and worse.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing I have control over, and that's open source. Open source has always been a way that I try to make the world a better place. Bringing new contributions to the community helps drives innovation and competition.\r\n\r\nLerna is a perfect example of that. Historically monorepos required a lot of infrastructure and only large teams and companies could afford to set it up and maintain it. They had a very expensive cost to them. Lerna made it available to everyone and the community has flourished around it.\r\n\r\nTool after tool, this is what we accomplish with open source. This is what we contribute back to the world. But today I want to do something more.\r\n\r\nAs we've learned over the last few years with Facebook, Uber, Google, and others. Tech companies do a lot of shady things behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nRecently it's come out that a lot of big tech companies are supporting ICE by providing them with infrastructure and in some cases doing significant development work for them. They all have their excuses, but the fact is that these companies care only about the millions of dollars that ICE is paying them and are willing to ignore all the horrible things that ICE does.\r\n\r\nRecently it has come to my attention that many of these companies which are being paid millions of dollars by ICE are also using some of the open source software that I helped build.\r\n\r\nNow, it's not news to me that people can use open source for evil. That's part of the whole deal.\r\n\r\nBut it's really hard for me to sit back and ignore what these companies are doing with my code. It doesn't feel like there are enough steps in between me and the horrible things ICE is doing.\r\n\r\nSo my plan now is to start licensing my software differently.\r\n\r\nI have spoken to Sebastian and Daniel about this and we all want Lerna to do the same.\r\n\r\nFor the companies that are known supporters of ICE: Lerna will no longer be licensed as MIT for you. You will receive no licensing rights and any use of Lerna will be considered theft. You will not be able to pay for a license, the only way that it is going to change is by you publicly tearing your contracts with ICE.\r\n",
