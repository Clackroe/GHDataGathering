There isn't major support for MauiKit, the likelihood is that most people probably never heard of it before today, and there is no widespread adoption of it. Can you name 10 large companies that have adopted it?\n> \n> Your attitude is as if Microsoft is being some big evil corporation. The reality is I highly doubt anybody heard of MauiKit, and frankly nobody cares.\n> \n> > Let's pretend that this is not a mirror but the official repository (not so).. can a project name be stolen because it has less fame?\n> \n> Ok let's look at kde... there are 10 open issues... are you seriously going to tell me that a serious cross platform framework has 10 open issues... that's not realistic in any shape way or form. So again your complaints are just being ridiculous.\n\nSo a project has value based on open issues?\n\nI have nothing against Microsoft, here we talk about a name and who chose it before (in the same context). \n\nI don't know how you can question the seriousness of one of the biggest communities that drive open source principles many years before Microsoft fell in love with open source.\n\n ",
