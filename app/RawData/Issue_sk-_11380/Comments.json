The rationale here was to specifically target static assets that don't change and in that case we struggled to find a compelling reason why you should cache for a week but not a month or more. And if not a month why isn't it at a year?\r\n\r\nI think my preference to capture the original intention behind the audit would be narrowing the scope to assets with hash or version-like components in their URL rather than to weaken the rule.",

Our thinking was \"hey if this thing actually changes, you probably want to keep it up to a year but throw `must-revalidate` on there or something instead.\"The best retort I think we've heard so far to that was \"we *would* ideally want `must-revalidate` *but* we're OK with very slightly stale responses without a revalidation to save requests so we use 4 hours instead\" The problem is there's no real way for us to differentiate that case from the case of poorly chosen cache lifetimes.
