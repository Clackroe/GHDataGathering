    "body": "Hello,\n\nunder the following circumstances, VS2017express replaces tabs with spaces even though I deactivated that feature in the options:\n- I am working on a C# file\n- I am pasting a tab from my clipboard into a line of code, but not at the end, e.g. &quot;int i = 0; // init i&quot;. If I want more space between the command and the comment and I use my tab key, then tabs get inserted properly, but if I put a tab into my clipboard and insert it with Ctrl-V, then ALL tabs get replaced with spaces.\n\nThis problem does not occur in C++ files of the same solution, even though I set the tab configuration identical for all languages.\n\nCheers\nPeter\n\n_This issue has been moved from https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/154651/vs2017express-c-tabs-replaced-with-spaces.html\nVSTS ticketId: 528589_\n_These are the original issue comments:_\n\nPeter Meier on \u200e11\u200e/\u200e23\u200e/\u200e2017, 02:27 AM (41 days ago): <p>Also I just found out that if I hit the auto format keys (Ctrl-K, Ctrl-D), all the tabs I inserted between the command and the comment are replaced with spaces again. I searched through Tools/Options/Text Editor/C#/Code Style/Formatting, but I found no way to change this annoying behavior. I don't understand why C# won't let me align my comments the way I want them to be when it's no problem for C++.</p>\n\nJinu Joseph [MSFT] on \u200e12\u200e/\u200e20\u200e/\u200e2017, 02:48 AM (14 days ago): <p>We appreciate you taking the time to report this problem.
