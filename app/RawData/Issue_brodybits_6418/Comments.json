They should also have the power to add more administrators like themselves if needed. (Most privileged maintainers should not have such extra administrator power.)\r\n\r\nI think this one action would be a MAJOR TECHNICAL LIFESAVER:\r\n- prevent the otherwise inevitable project fork that is under discussion here, #6413, and #6109, among other places\r\n- keep this project at the existing quality level\r\n- avoid the dead project syndrome\r\n\r\nBy \"project fork\" I mean a significant portion of the team split off, like what happened with node.js in the past. I think it would be much better to keep this project as one united team if possible.\r\n\r\n@jlukic I would like to commend you for the major efforts it must have taken on your part to get this project this far.

However, it's being smothered by inactivity and the inability of other members to step in. \r\n\r\nThe `dead project syndrome` is already rearing it's head when pull requests to fix bugs are being auto-closed due to inactivity... I see new bug reports and KNOW that I can fix it, but why bother if it's for naught and the fix gets ignored. **I love Semantic UI**, and if this project where to come back to life would happily set aside a dedicated amount of time to find and fix issues on a regular basis. I've stopped paying attention to the project over the last year, and even explored other UI libraries because it no longer seems to be moving forward.\r\n\r\nIt's at a critical point now, other passionate members are literally begging for the ability to maintain a project they love. I'm sure they want to avoid a fork, we need active maintainers that can keep this project running while you are sorting out funding. There are even members trying to maintain their own forks/versions.\r\n",

I think that will make a major difference for everyone involved.\r\n\r\nI can only imagine the stress you must be facing between a project with over 41K stars and the funding challenges.\r\n\r\nI do continue to feel pretty disappointed that the active project ownership that is so badly is still not coming in the near term. I guess we come to the inevitable second-choice alternative of forking, though some competitive fork ideas such as <https://github.com/morganbarrett/Vanilla-Semantic-UI> may prove really nice for some members of the community.",

At the same time I must mention one thing: **you will not succeed on your own**.\r\n\r\nIn that regard I find it highly confusing - and disrespectful imho - that you chose to ignore all suggestions to delegate power to trusted contributors who would like to help you to maintain SUI 2.x. Which would _reduce_ your already high work load.\r\n\r\n### Solving UI for the web\r\n\r\nThis task is too great to be solved by a single person. The key here is not to solely depend on your brainpower - instead, multiply by giving others authority. I know you know this. You already talked with others about splitting up the workload, but your actions currently tell another story.\r\n\r\nIf \"Solving UI for the web\" **truly** is your goal, then I'd advise you to rethink your stance on delegation. \r\n\r\nYou already showed you have what it takes to do this! You built this awesome ship which *could* solve UI for the web. But it's gotten too big for you to micro manage every damn aspect of it. Let others help you with its navigation!\r\n\r\nPS: You will still be the captain ;)",
