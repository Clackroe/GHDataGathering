    "body": "I started using Godot lately, and I find it ingenious. I am using a Mac, and while I don't intend to release something Mac-only in the end, it is the best development platform for me, as well as many others.\r\n\r\nFollowing the news regarding the deprecation of OpenGL for Apple platforms I saw this issue on GitHub, https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/19368 and I personally feel that the issues raised by the Godot team are all valid. It also seems that the team has already planned Vulkan support, and Mac / iOS will be supported using MoltenVK.\r\n\r\nHowever, before this happens, I would like to throw another option to the table, which is using bgfx as a rendering backend. https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx\r\n\r\nBGFX has DirectX, OpenGL, and Metal support out of the box and will soon add Vulkan support (https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx/issues/274). MoltenVK for Mac also seems like a viable option, but it has some limitations atm (https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/blob/master/Docs/MoltenVK_Runtime_UserGuide.md#limitations) which I have to admit I don't know how much they affect Godot (if at all).\r\n\r\nSince BGFX's API allows supporting multiple rendering backends without changing its core API, perhaps using this instead of investing time only in Vulkan will be better for Godot in the long run?\r\n\r\nI totally respect Godot team's decisions regarding Vulkan, and I trust that if Godot chooses this path it will work as good as now - if not better. I just threw the BGFX idea in order to have some feedback on whether BGFX was something that was already considered - and what is the team's opinion on choosing BGFX instead of investing time only on Vulkan support (also having to trust that MoltenVK will always work as advertised).",
