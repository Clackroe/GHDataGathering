Lots of people here manage to be constructive and positive and I'd appreciate your effort in not starting fights with us or other contributors. I've asked you to do this once already and am not going to ask a third time - if you continue to be combative to people just trying to help, we'll be asking you to discontinue your engagement on the issue tracker.\r\n\r\nTurning to the issue at hand, I think we need to figure out what the right solution is relative to #17002. In that issue (`Array.isArray` and `ReadOnlyArray<T>`), it seemed like the preference from people was that narrowing e.g. `string | ReadonlyArray<number>` with `isArray` should yield `ReadonlyArray<number>`. not `Array<number>`.\r\n\r\nIt'd be confusing if `string | Iterable<number>` narrowed to `Iterable<number>` but narrowing `Iterable<number>` produced `Array<number>` - the `isArray` type guard should uniformly either produce a subtype or filter a union, not do one or the other depending on whether the argument type has some unrelated (e.g. known-`false`-returning) union constituents.\r\n\r\nAlso an open question: surely it's not *just* `Iterable` and `ReadonlyArray` that want special treatment? Are there other types? How does this impact #28916",
