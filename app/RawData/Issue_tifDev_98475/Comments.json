The PR revealed some usability issues with the feature and it was marked as out of scope by someone intimately familiar with the editor.\r\n\r\nRealistically this would also not get prioritized for the team to work on so it would only come in via a PR, and we've already attempted and spent a bunch of time on it reviewing, testing and fixing in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/53963. It would also be a major feature in terms of work required to implement and maintain, but it would very rarely get used because it's an opt-in.\r\n\r\nThe bot helps us manage issues and it messed up here by not applying the feature request label and starting the timer in May, if it did maybe it would have reached 20 upvotes in time but I also made a mistake by not closing it out as a duplicate of https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/44214 to begin with.",
