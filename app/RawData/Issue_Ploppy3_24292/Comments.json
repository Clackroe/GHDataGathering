        "body": "Hi there :slightly_smiling_face: :wave: \r\n\r\nJust wanted to give my two cents on this issue\r\n\r\nI believe that this is not a bug but an actual feature request and one which I don't really agree too much with, my reasoning being that the delay applies to the enter transition, so you are asking the framework to delay the animation after the element has been inserted, which is very different from delaying the insertion of the element. It is the same as applying a standard css animation to an element, if you provide a delay it will not cause the element not to be styled or anything like that, and that's exactly what happens here.\r\n\r\nSo as a silly simple example, let's imagine that in my app I want elements to be inserted, and then with some delay I want apply an animation to the newly inserted elements to catch the attention of the user (but I don't want to animate the insertion of the element), like I did in this [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-drwu7e) for example. I think that such application of the delay is totally reasonable.\r\n\r\nWe do however have all the tools needed to implement what you need, in my example if we wanted the element not to be displayed until the animation kicks in then we could add styles for doing so (as I did in this [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-sa2oya) for example).\r\n\r\nHaving the framework do this sort of things for us to me requires the framework to make assumptions as to what the user would want to do (which can't always be clear since as I showed you may not want the opacity to be 0 initially, or someone could tweak the size of the element instead of its opacity to make it \"enter\" the page) and automagically make it work, this sort of thing usually causes more issues than its worth in my opinion and it should be up to the user to clearly declare what the animation should look like, instead of asking the framework to figure it out itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n@csvn your issue is something different, it looks like a bug related to the `animation` function not applying the delay, as you can see from this [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-1mvaeu) if you avoid the use of the `animation` function then the delay happens as expected, so yours I believe is an actual bug (unrelated to this issue).\r\n(I've created a new issue regarding the bug: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/47283, I hope you don't mind :slightly_smiling_face: )",
