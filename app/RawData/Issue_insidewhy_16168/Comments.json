So components that relied on it a lot introduced a lot of refactoring friction, and didn't catch valuable regressions anyway for us. (Your experience might differ.)\r\n\r\nThe main value proposition of shallow rendering is that you mock out the inner components. We see the value in this, but in our experience doing this at the module system level gives you more leeway when refactoring. For example, you can always `jest.mock('Button', () => 'button')` to replace a child `Button` component with a mock. We've mostly been happy with this approach and found it more flexible.\r\n\r\nSince we don't use the shallow renderer much anymore, we don't feel like we would be good stewards of its API, or even can recommend it. Additionally, Enzyme has been adding different behavior to it (such as calling class commit phase lifecycles) that we didn't originally plan. At least some of it was due to a misunderstanding (for example, React intends to guarantee refs are resolved in the commit phase, but running code with shallow renderer forces you to handle null gracefully). But there is also some mismatch between how Enzyme uses it internally, and how we initially thought it would be used.\r\n\r\n**At this point I think it would be better if we could move out the shallow renderer out of this repository.** It's stagnating here, getting fixes very late, and causes frustration like in this PR. By design, it doesn't use almost any of the React code, so it should be easy to move. On the other hand, Enzyme is in active development and might as well want to take ownership of this piece.\r\n\r\nIf @davidmarkclements were kind to offer the `react-shallow-renderer` package name, we could externalize it there, and maybe it could be maintained in the Enzyme repository or elsewhere instead.\r\n\r\nWould anyone like to propose a plan? Thanks.",

So components that relied on it a lot introduced a lot of refactoring friction, and didn't catch valuable regressions anyway for us. (Your experience might differ.)\r\n> \r\n> The main value proposition of shallow rendering is that you mock out the inner components. We see the value in this, but in our experience doing this at the module system level gives you more leeway when refactoring. For example, you can always `jest.mock('Button', () => 'button')` to replace a child `Button` component with a mock. We've mostly been happy with this approach and found it more flexible.\r\n> \r\n> Since we don't use the shallow renderer much anymore, we don't feel like we would be good stewards of its API, or even can recommend it. Additionally, Enzyme has been adding different behavior to it (such as calling class commit phase lifecycles) that we didn't originally plan. At least some of it was due to a misunderstanding (for example, React intends to guarantee refs are resolved in the commit phase, but running code with shallow renderer forces you to handle null gracefully). But there is also some mismatch between how Enzyme uses it internally, and how we initially thought it would be used.\r\n> \r\n> **At this point I think it would be better if we could move out the shallow renderer out of this repository.** It's stagnating here, getting fixes very late, and causes frustration like in this PR. By design, it doesn't use almost any of the React code, so it should be easy to move. On the other hand, Enzyme is in active development and might as well want to take ownership of this piece.\r\n> \r\n> If @davidmarkclements were kind to offer the `react-shallow-renderer` package name, we could externalize it there, and maybe it could be maintained in the Enzyme repository or elsewhere instead.\r\n> \r\n> Would anyone like to propose a plan? Thanks.\r\n\r\nWhat do you recommend using instead? ",

By making it part of the public interface of the class, we can hook into it and implement whatever effects we want from outside?\r\n\r\nIn the long term, to extract the shallow renderer, couldn't the `shared` package just be published?\r\n\r\nBut please consider implementing my first proposal. In the react-native world the shallow renderer is very popular, not being able to use (test) hooks makes us very sad.",

        "body": "> Generally we've been using shallow renderer less and less at Facebook because it encourages brittle tests \r\n\r\n@gaearon just curious, is that because those specific components don't have static typing (like Flow) to enforce that nested components get instantiated correctly? Even with Flow, it's sometimes tricky to truly enforce component signatures, e.g. when using poorly typed HOCs.\r\n\r\nIt's true that shallow rendering won't expose problems like passing invalid props but static typing *can* solve this when done correctly.\r\n\r\n> The main value proposition of shallow rendering is that you mock out the inner components. We see the value in this, but in our experience doing this at the module system level gives you more leeway when refactoring. For example, you can always `jest.mock('Button', () => 'button')` to replace a child `Button` component with a mock. We've mostly been happy with this approach and found it more flexible.\r\n\r\nHuh. To me, it seems way more flexible to rely on shallow rendering for this because the test doesn't have to *know* which dependencies to mock. This is important for refactoring; a test should not break when you add/remove nested components since they are not relevant to the main component under test -- nested components already have their own responsibilities.\r\n\r\nI also like how shallow rendering encourages the test author to *only* consider functionality that the component under test is responsible for.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Since we don't use the shallow renderer much anymore, we don't feel like we would be good stewards of its API, or even can recommend it. \r\n\r\nThat makes sense, I was just curious to understand why, in case I'm missing some flaws in shallow rendering.\r\n",
