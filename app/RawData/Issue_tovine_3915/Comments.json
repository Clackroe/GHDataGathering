I was about to open a new report because this issue also doesn't capture the entire story. But instead I'll post some findings here and hope that you can shed some more light on what the plans are.\r\n\r\nFirst, the problem is not just that the console sessions are silently closed when the program automatically updates. I haven't been able to fully trace what set of circumstances causes this, but I've had processes just get orphaned. The only reason I even realize this is that when I go to re-open one of my command line processes, I see that the listening port is still in use and I can't open it. I've then had to go searching through TCPView and Process Explorer to find the orphaned process and kill it.\r\n\r\nSecond, I tried to circumvent all of this by installing the Terminal app via Chocolatey. However, it still gets updated via the Windows Store!? I'm not sure why that would happen if I did not install via the Store.\r\n\r\nAt the very least I would _LOVE_ an option to disable automatic updates. Another solution might be to tie _all_ updates to Terminal to the next Windows reboot cycle? But I think from your comments on other threads this is what you aren't able to do when distributing via the Store. \r\n\r\nI would also make the recommendation to just not distribute this application on the Windows Store. This is not really an ideal app for that delivery mechanism. This is a power user / developer targeted app, so I would think it would be distributed more like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, or even Power Toys.\r\n\r\nThanks for your teams work on this app. Unfortunately I am going to have to abandon it until this issue is fixed because I'm losing a lot of time and work every other week when an update is pushed and my long-running processes are lost.\r\n",
