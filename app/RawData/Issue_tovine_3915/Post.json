Then proceed!\r\n-->\r\nOn several occasions I've experienced that when I leave my computer for a while and come back, all my terminal windows are gone.\r\nAfter some investigation I've reached the conclusion that this happens because the app was installed through the Microsoft store, and just received an update.\r\n\r\nThis is probably fine for your average note taking app or Candy Crush game, but for a terminal with several tabs open that do actual work (and perhaps even long-running (like several days) processes open in remote SSH sessions) this is completely unacceptable.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to avoid the terminal being restarted after receiving an update through the Store? A notification would be fine to let me know that I should restart it on the earliest convenient moment, but having it just disappear can in the worst case scenario cost me days of work that will need to be restarted, and in the best case some inconvenience and a few minutes to get back to where I was before...\r\n\r\nLuckily a workaround exists: disable apps auto-updating (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15081/windows-turn-on-automatic-app-updates), but is there really no better way of handling this?\r\n<!--\r\nThis bug tracker is monitored by Windows Terminal development team and other technical folks.\r\n\r\n**Important: When reporting BSODs or security issues, DO NOT attach memory dumps, logs, or traces to Github issues**.\r\nInstead, send dumps/traces to secure@microsoft.com, referencing this GitHub issue.\r\n\r\nIf this is an application crash, please also provide a Feedback Hub submission link so we can find your diagnostic data on the backend.
