Suggesting that asking people to \"be nice\" is an attempt at ending discussion is one of the strangest stretches I've ever heard. As someone that called maintainers cowards for reverting the changes and removing Jamie, I can get a strong sense of why you'd argue that point, however.\r\n\r\nAs for this issue, @TheLarkInn made it pretty clear that they'd like to wait for the dust to settle prior to a formal RFC. That makes sense. Right now Lerna is a target for people only interested in politics, and once the dust settles they will likely have something new to chase, and the people actually interested in the project can contribute to the suggested RFC.",

I said, quite explicitly, that Lerna is currently a target for those disinterested in the project and overly interested in the politics. By waiting for the dust to settle, we can ensure that any RFC is targeting the actual community. I'm not suggesting that everyone that supported Jamie is a troll, I'm saying that right now Lerna is going to attract them. Wait a few days and they'll be busy trolling someone else so we can get active interest in the discussion, including those that disagree with reverting the change. ",

        "body": "Re: \"cooling off\" and \"people interested only in politics\"...\r\n\r\nI'm seeing an extremely ill-informed opinion being bandied about that implies the current state of open source is apolitical. FSF was founded on some radically collectivist ideals. OSI on more radically libertarian ones. \"Open source principles\" are what they are because people planted the flag and did the work to make them that way. The reason this project is MIT instead of GPL in the first place is because of decades of ideological debate and changes in community expectations.\r\n\r\nPlanting a different flag and doing a different thing is not more or less political than the status quo. To suggest otherwise is ahistorical nonsense. It's not more political; it's merely more participatory.\r\n\r\nI'm simultaneously intrigued by the effort to change the license and skeptical of what its effects might be. Maybe reverting was a good idea! It would have for sure been _more interesting_ to see the experiment run its course, but I understand the fear to the health of the project that makes someone walk it back.\r\n\r\nOf course this attracted wider attention. Of course people who were otherwise mostly foreign to lerna were intrigued and came running. You were doing something mad and exciting and extremely political. A big project was finally taking an ethical question and putting it front and center and saying \"Yeah, it's time to talk about this.\"\r\n\r\nPost-blowback, you don't wanna be political pioneers anymore. And who does? A) It's hard, and B) that's not how most of us want to spend our OSS time.\r\n\r\nIf you're overwhelmed, frazzled, can't handle being the center of this ethical discussion you started, and just want to be left alone to code now... You could just say so? I mean that completely earnestly. It's okay to get in over your head and ask to be let back out. At least _I_ think so.",

Project maintainers who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team. \r\n\r\nThese are the segments of the current lerna Code of Conduct that justify our decisions made to revoke all of James involvement and ownership privileges over this GitHub Organization. \r\n\r\nIn multiple GitHub issues (if you need me to cite them, I will do so but in additional comments or edits from this response), on Twitter [important to note he claims ownership of lerna in this context making him profesionally represented and in the capacity of a maintainer] acts in a very unprofessional, rude, and harassing manner.\r\n\r\nThese also have been occurring since July which @evocateur official states in our license change PR #1633 that we made a mistake in this regard to not address earlier violations in a swift and timely manner. \r\n\r\nAs a core team, going forward, we want to not only protect the interest of the project itself, but also the transparency of the project. And that means we need to adopt a much less vague, less interpretive, and more structured Code of Conduct. For that we have open up #1636 per request (I on twitter officially asked Coraline to create this issue).\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the core team who is all actively monitoring this issue, I hope it provides the clarity that you are seeking. Thank you for sticking up for a transparent and responsible process. \r\n\r\n_Note: @hannahhoward once you have your clarifications received (even if you don't explicitly request them), would you confirm your question has been answered? That way I can prevent thread abuse by locking and maintainers can add cited incidents in the issue._",
