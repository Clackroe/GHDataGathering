Thanks! We don't have a template RFC format, or spec template, but hopefully looking to have one once we catchup and dust settles.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's not clear what specifically such an RFC would look like, and what it's format would take. Since then no issue has been opened.\r\n\r\nThis issue is simply to register there is dissent among a portion of Lerna users about the decision of the core team to revert Jamie's license change and remove him from the project until an RFC can be opened. \r\n\r\nIt is precisely the time when people are paying attention when discussion is necessary, when a wider group of perspectives can be heard.",
