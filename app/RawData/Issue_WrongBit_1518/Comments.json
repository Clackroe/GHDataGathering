WinUI is the UI framework, and can be updated faster than the OS.\r\n\r\nAs for your views about Windows 10, you are entitled to believe what you like, but Windows 7 is coming to an end, and if you do not wish to remain a Windows user, there is macOS and various forms of Linux, for you to choose from.\r\n\r\nI however suspect your comments are a little disingenuous, but I hope I have provided an accurate answer to your query.",
