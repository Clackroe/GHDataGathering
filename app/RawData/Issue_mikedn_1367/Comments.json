But we need to be careful that we don't use valuable contributions as a currency to offset disrespectful behavior.\r\n\r\n@mikedn\r\n\r\n> I have no idea why terrajobst felt the need to comment on it after more than a month.\r\n\r\nPurely practical reasons -- I was only made aware of this issue today and I believe what I said needed to be said.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to create an inclusive and respectful community and that includes all of us: Microsoft employees, frequent contributors, and newcomers. But these are only hollow words unless we're willing to drive change where necessary. And that includes reminding people to be respectful if their actions aren't and removing people who refuse to do so. From looking at the OSS ecosystem and listening to other communities it's clear to me that ignoring toxic behavior in the spirit of taking the high road does nothing but normalizing said toxic behavior. That's why I said what I said.\r\n\r\n> Well, I appreciate they're appreciated but at the same time I don't really care. I did not contribute to get praise, I only contributed for the fun of it.\r\n\r\nI can very much relate to that. Thus, I'd ask you to consider that this applies to other people as well.

We're all guilty of saying things that come across much harsher than we intended. Being respectful doesn't mean not making mistakes, it means unwillingness to learn from them and/or doubling down on them. And I for one am not willing to tell people to suck it up because that's just the culture we have. We generally don't have that culture internally or with our community.

First of all, it's not an insightful comment from your end. If you want other people to learn, you need to give them more information beyond \"you're wrong\". But more importantly it's just plain rude. You're basically sending him the signal of \"you're not welcome here\".\r\n\r\nBut instead of apologizing or even just letting that feedback sink in, you're now trying to turn the tables by saying you got victimized by Tanner because he asked you a technical question and that it's unreasonable from our end to ask you to be respectful in your responses to him.\r\n\r\nYou're more than welcome to continue to contribute to .NET. But I'll be clear: if we observe behavior like this in the future, we'll ultimately block you. We can't have other contributors stop engaging with us because of your behavior. While your contributions are valued, they don't warrant losing other contributors as collateral damage.",
