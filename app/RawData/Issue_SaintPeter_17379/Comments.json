We would love some help though. Its been a little while since the new curriculum was first brought in (I mean added to the beta) by the contributors, so yeah it could use the polishing up.\r\n\r\nI know of a lot of contributors who have done some great work like @ahmadabdolsaheb @mstellaluna and @scissorsneedfoodtoo recently, just to name a few off the top of my head.\r\n\r\nThe other thing is that us shipping the platform (splitting up the curriculum infra and the user backend) has broken the contributing pipeline. The new challenge infra is supper snappy and powerful BTW. So some real potential there, that we did not have previously. No more monkey patching `console.log` !!\r\n\r\nThe challenge and user schema has changed, the tooling has changed (for good though, which we will see in a few days hopefully, when we fix things for the local setup).\r\n\r\nWe are working toward improving to the DX for contributors, as soon as we have the production really stable for us to focus on the contributions. There has been a great surge in people wanting to contribute. We are just a little swamped the moment with the support and user priority issues.",

I thought for sure there would be a way to solve it with only .filter() because they haven't even said what the other functions do when you get to this exercise, or that it's possible to chain them together. I managed to solve it with a really ugly workaround, still using .map() but forgot about .parseInt() and that you can chain the functions...\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst filteredIntegers = arr.filter(n => n > 0 && n%2 == 1|| n%2 == 0); \r\nconst squaredIntegers = filteredIntegers.map(x => Math.pow(x,2));\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheers!",

It definitely took some serious google searching to figure out a solution, since .map(), .filter(), and .reduce() had not been previously mentioned. I also only really grasped that I could chain and nest functions like:\r\n\r\n`const squaredIntegers = arr.filter((num) => num > 0 && num == Math.floor(num)).map((num) => num * num);`\r\n\r\ndue to having learned some through Grasshopper before I started with FCC. I think some challenge on that concept before this one would've been useful, as well as challenges on filter, map, and reduce.\r\n\r\nI know the chaining isn't necessarily required... but at this point in the challenges where the theme seems to be on condensing code, IMO it's the perfect time to bring it up.\r\n\r\nOr in the meantime, maybe we could just point the text for the map, filter, and reduce to their relevant challenges later on, or to relevant tutorials elsewhere on the internet if FCC doesn't currently have challenges for those concepts?",

        "body": "@chrisdel101, great that you started on this!\r\n\r\nSeeing local changes is a bit of a process. First you need to reseed the db with `npm run seed`, then enter `npm run bootstrap`. When the last command is finished, enter `npm run develop`, then refresh the page when that's ready. You should be able to see your changes after that.\r\n\r\nAs for number 2, yes, that's the test. Tests come in pairs with a string for text and another for the testString. Text is what the user will see on the left side of the page before tests are run. The test string itself is made up of two parts--the first is the actual test, then the string after the comma which is shown in the console if the test fails.\r\n\r\nAs for the actual test suite, I believe we're using Chai. There's a cheat sheet that might help you write your tests here: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/da0df12ab7b3bae46c2a376da246a6c499afd88b/guide/english/miscellaneous/chaijs-cheatsheet/index.md\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways you could work with functions here. How were you thinking of rewriting the challenge? A lot of the times the tests look at the return value of the function. The third test currently does this: \r\n\r\n```\r\n- text: <code>squaredIntegers</code> should be <code>[16, 1764, 36]</code>\r\n    testString: assert.deepStrictEqual(squaredIntegers, [16, 1764, 36], '<code>squaredIntegers</code> should be <code>[16, 1764, 36]</code>');\r\n```",

I need to run `npm run bootstrap` to see them. Is there a way around this?\r\n\r\n I'm familiar with Chai but will have to play around with the tests to fully get what is going on.\r\n\r\nAs for what I was going to re-write, just going to focus more on the syntax and remove the need for the function to be written in a particular way, i.e. it has to have an array named a certain way inside of it. This kind of change is what @SaintPeter suggested I do above.",
