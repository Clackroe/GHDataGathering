        "body": "As @kmgallahan and @shaheedmalik already pointed out this is quite a difficult issue.\r\nSupporting multi line text is really difficult, since we don't know if the text is multiline or not. For larger font sizes, the checkbox needs to center, for smaller font sizes, the text needs to center. This however is problematic with multiline text.\r\n\r\nFor text that is single line, finding a solution is quite easy, since we can simply center everything. However with multiline text, centering the checkbox may look weird:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16122379/69326819-bf9ce600-0c4c-11ea-932b-ab8aa0669e79.png)\r\n\r\nSince CheckBox currently is a winrt component (AFAIK), adding new properties is not an option. However, [according to the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/checkbox#dos-and-donts), a checkbox should not have more than two lines of text, which would look okayish:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16122379/69328526-aba6b380-0c4f-11ea-9fce-54c42540768f.png)\r\n\r\nThe same problem also applies to RadioButtons, however we could introduce a custom property in this case.\r\n",
