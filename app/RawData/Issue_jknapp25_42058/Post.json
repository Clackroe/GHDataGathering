It would be nice if I didn't have to go back to this view and scroll up and down it to get an indication of how much I have left.\r\n\r\nFor me, I think a feature like this would keep me more engaged and therefore reduce the likelihood of me not finishing a module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3934326/117497796-c9dc9e00-af2d-11eb-9baf-7097a372b657.png)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI think there are many ways this could be done, here a few I could think of:\r\n- Percentage of completion\r\n- Ratio\r\n- Approximation of remaining time. Given FCC has data on average time to completion on each challenge. _Just curious, where does the 300hr estimation come from?_\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThere is some useful discussion that has already happened on the FCC forum [here](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/new-feature-indicator-of-module-level-progress/459290).\r\n\r\nI think it's fair to say that this is a simple feature to experiment with. If users say it's helpful, and it increases engagement, I say keep it. If not, then toss it. I remember being surprised it wasn't included when I first started though.",
