The variance in time to competition between users is already pretty high and we already have to tell a decent number of users that its ok if they go 'too fast' or 'too slow' wrt the 300 hours.\r\n\r\nIt is really tempting to provide numbers because of the assumption that more numbers = more information = more better. But aggregating data that is too dissimilar is a common statistical sin that we shouldn't be showing our users.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think this would add clutter to the simpler UX.",

Does it keep users motivated? Yes - The #100DaysOfCode challenge is one of those initiatives. \r\n\r\nI am 100% in agreement with you that we can never design a program that will give exact report of where a learner stands in terms of knowledge gained. An 80% completion does not mean a user has 80% mastery on the topic. \r\n\r\n@jknapp25 @jeremylt \r\n\r\nLet's keep this thread constructive towards an actual implementation. You should continue to deliberate on the forum thread for pros-cons. Deliberation is a good thing to vet out a feature.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile let me check with the team and get back to you, after discussing this more objectively.\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience and comments everyone.",

But maybe the value in a metric like this is that it simply re-inforces that progress is being made. Re-orienting the learner in a way.

        "body": "@jknapp25 Thank you, for opening this feature request. We have spent a lot of time going back-and-forth between ideas. One of the main discussions occurred here: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/39265\r\n\r\nUltimately, the decision was:\r\n> It looks cool, but there are a few things that prevent visual representation from working well here:\r\n\r\n>For each certification, the lessons only constitute about 16% of the cert. The other 84% is the certification projects. This means that on the first certification, a camper could make it through a hundred or more lessons and only be 5 or 6% of the way done with the certification. So all they would see would be a tiny slice of the pie for their first 50 hours of coding.\r\n\r\n>This is why I recommended using the (300 hours - 1.03% complete) text. Because we really need that level of granularity in the numbers. Otherwise progress would be virtually invisible from one coding session to the next.\r\n\r\n>Also, people may wonder \"what is this thing over on the right hand margin\"? The \"X.XX% complete\" text is unambiguous.\r\n\r\n>Thus, if you want to implement a text-based version of this, we would be very interested in this.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo, there is still scope to implement such a feature, but keeping in mind the discussion had in this issue, and the linked PR.\r\n\r\nWe welcome PoCs (proof of concepts) - as you have done, or more; visual communication is appreciated. However, it is in your and our best interest to read through the current/past discussion so as to not end up spending hours on something which ultimately might not be used.\r\n\r\nHope this adds to the discussion.",
