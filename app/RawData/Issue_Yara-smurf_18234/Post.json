Enemy harvester tries to crush them. Grenadiers walk to the side and start aiming at the harvester instead of continuing the attack on the ref. I observed that now in a couple of RAGL matches :/\r\n\r\n## Reproduction\r\nAttack building with inf, enemy harvesters tries to crush your inf. Your inf dodge and stops attacking the building, but whatever is around. \r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nInfantry should keep the focus on whatever they were trying to do before. \r\n",
