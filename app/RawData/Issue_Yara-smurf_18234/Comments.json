I wouldn't mind if it was like this in OpenRA too and players were forced to scatter units manually\r\n- Add auto-dodge. In this case it should integrate well, which for me means that units don't just forget what they were told to do when dodging. The feature you are suggesting makes little sense to me, because if you opt for QoL then it should it should be done right, and units should not become idle in the nowhere after having dodged a vehicle. This is nothing we know from the original game.\r\n\r\nSo if you were asking to remove the auto-dodging completely I'd probably support that, but don't see any value in not fixing the IMO undesired side-effects of the current behavior.",

Both are actions made independant of players will\r\n\r\nThese are two different cases: RTB is an activity that is triggered when the aircraft is out of ammo and the specific deliberately chosen behavior is nothing anyone desires but a result of an unsolved conflict in design ideas, that auto-RTB should be part of the game, which circling yaks are the main offender for. Such a conflict does not exist in this issue and there is no reason to make one up. The queue cancellation here leads to units becoming idle, resulting in target-loss and #5968.
