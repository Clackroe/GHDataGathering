In any case where this could happen, which could be almost any fp operation, it would then be up to the game author to add NaN checks before any dictionary insertion. Nobody is going to do that.\r\n\r\nSince dictionary/list indexing is not a mathematical operation, but rather a symbolic one, I don't see why disallowing NaN makes much sense. This is just an implementation detail of this particular possible symbol.",
