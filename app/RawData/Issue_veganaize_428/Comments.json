However, when fresh source files are created, the BOM is probably best avoided, in accordance with the Unicode/UTF-8 recommendation.\r\n\r\nIt follows the programming principle: \"Be liberal in what you accept and conservative in what you send.\"\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "Hi veganaize, first, let me say thank you for sending this PR; I should have done so in an earlier comment. Rejecting the PR is in no way a statement about you, nor your qualifications. Although it's true that Google's public style guides are under-curated (a situation we all lament, but no one has stepped up to address) we care very deeply about the contents of our style guides, and therefore are very conservative in what we add to it. My intent here was to bring closure to this issue, since it had unfortunately sat unaddressed for some time.\r\n\r\nYou are absolutely right that there are situations where a BOM can matter, and it is reasonable to discourage their use. In our experience at Google this has not been a major issue (admittedly, most internal development happens on Linux, so issues related to `.bat` scripting are indeed something we don't typically run into). Looking into historical internal discussions around BOMs affecting Google Java developers I can find very little, and nothing related to BOMs in the `.java` source files themselves. None of which invalidates your concern, but in our opinion it doesn't rise to a level of severity to merit calling out in the Style Guide. Many best practices are intentionally not included in the guide simply because we don't want to make a ruling we don't have to. We trust teams to identify their own best practices where we don't make stipulations.\r\n\r\nOf note, this doesn't appear to be a Java-specific issue, and I notice only the HTML/CSS guide makes any mention of it. Perhaps we should consistently discourage BOMs across all our style guides, but I don't believe it's necessary to make the Java guide an outlier in this regard.\r\n\r\n> If I ever make a contribution to Google I will be sure to include that BOM.\r\n\r\nI would ask that you do so with good-faith, but *please do* include a BOM if you believe it is relevant. We put a lot of faith in our tooling, and count on developers both internally and externally to help catch places where our tooling falls short. If a BOM breaks something we rely on, we will want to fix it. You might even [get paid](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/) if you are able to find an exploit related to mishandling of BOMs.\r\n\r\n> And here I'd thought that Google workers were above mansplaining. Stupid me.\r\n\r\nOne of the things I have deeply, deeply valued about my time at Google has been the candid and open discussions around issues of identity, gender inequality, and respect. We continue to fall short in many ways, but I am proud of the effort my peers have made to create a culture that is welcoming and inclusive. I don't believe anything I've said could fairly be labeled mansplaining, but I am sorry that I was curt. Again, thank you for raising this issue.",
