From the sounds of it, DWM is getting involved during our paint and slowing us down, but I wouldn't have the faintest clue how to start debugging that. \r\n\r\n@bitcrazed anyone on the DWM, or composition, or something team that we can forward this issue to to have them take a look?",

        "body": "Hey @powercode. I've been doing some repro'ing on my SP4 with an external 4K 28\" screen:\r\n\r\n| Font @ 18pt, Console @ 81x25 chars | Font @ 36pt, Console @ 81x25 chars |\r\n|:-|:-|\r\n| Command:  dir C:\\Windows\\System32\\ -recurse | Command:  dir C:\\Windows\\System32\\ -recurse | \r\n| Start:   12:50:21.47 | Start:   12:52:04.63 |\r\n| End:     12:50:23.52 | End:     12:52:09.44 |\r\n| Elapsed: 00:00:02.05 | Elapsed: 00:00:04.81 |\r\n\r\n> FWIW, I used my [timing script](https://github.com/bitcrazed/PowerRazzle/blob/master/TimedRun.cmd) to measure the elapsed time to execute and render the recursive listing command above.\r\n\r\nWith the font set at 36pt, there is indeed a marked slow-down, but remember:\r\n1. Console currently uses GDI to draw text which uses your CPU to render text glyphs\r\n1. GDI generates and caches glyphs, and then BLITs them onto the screen\r\n1. The larger the glyph, the fewer can be cached\r\n1. At 18pt, the client area is 1053x675. At 36pt, the client area is 2025x1350 and the resulting glyphs are 4x bigger ... that's a lot of LARGE bitmaps to BLIT\r\n1. And since scrolling often results in significant text changes between iterations of the render loop, the entire client area can end up being \"dirtied\", resulting in the full Console client area having to be fully re-rendered each time! 2025x1350 x 4bytes each pixel == 10MB per frame x 60 fps == 656MB/s we have to force from your CPU to the GPU's frame buffer every second!. \r\n\r\nThat's a lot of data by anyone's measure, and it makes one's machine do a lot of work:\r\n\r\n![recursive-dir](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/961950/44121072-5daffba8-9fd3-11e8-9831-49e00faa5233.png)\r\n\r\nNow, can we go faster? HELLS YEAH! \ud83d\ude1c\r\n\r\nThe GDI team recently improved their glyph caching mechanism, with more improvements planned for future releases, but increased the Glyph Cache buffer to mitigate the above factors until those improvements can be made.\r\n\r\nAlso, Console plans on replacing our GDI renderer to DirectWrite at some point in the future which should eliminate this issue anyhow. \r\n\r\n_Also_ we have some other tricks up our sleeves that we hope will noticeably improve text rendering perf, esp. while scrolling. Bear with us ;)\r\n\r\nI'll leave this issue open for now, and we'll update it when we have any solid perf improvements to share.",
