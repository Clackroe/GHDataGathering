Consider using these terms in a coding or systems interview with someone you have just met.\r\n\r\nI understand that some black people may not consider these terms offensive, but I would rather someone not want to work with me because they think I am too politically correct than because they think I am too insensitive and blind.\r\n\r\n@minaslater thanks for beating me to the first PR on this. :) \ud83d\udcaf ",
