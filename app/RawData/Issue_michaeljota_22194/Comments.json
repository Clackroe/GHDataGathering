They did switch to jQuery lite in Boostrap 4 and are using tether in replacement for what might otherwise be a jQuery plug-in, so that's a good step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIf you're only supporting modern browsers you may want to look at a CSS microframework like [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) and roll your own JS. To get a feel for what the JavaScript might start to look like if you wanted to roll vanilla and support older browsers, check out the [PhotoSwipe](http://photoswipe.com) example code.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if you're trying to improve performance for mobile, you may want to look at how to [load Bootstrap dependencies asynchronously](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/22139).",
