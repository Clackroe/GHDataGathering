    "body": "Hi! I wondering if you have plans for release a jQuery free version of Bootstrap. I search for this, but did not find anything about it. I know it's been a lifetime together, but all the good things comes to an end, and that's not bad. I guess web just had evolved in something that doesn't need jQuery. \r\n\r\nThere are several CSS frameworks that relays on jQuery, but this is the biggest, if this start to ship a jQuery free version, I bet that others would also consider this as well. \r\n\r\nThis would made integration with other JS frameworks and libraries more lightweight and straightforward. \r\n\r\nAnyhow, just wondering, if this is a duplicate, I'm really sorry, I try my best to find something about this, I guess it's not easy topic to search about.
