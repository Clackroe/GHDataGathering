We are paying commission in the Play Store, paying account fees and Google provides tools for making applications which will gain more money for Google. It's simple consumption chain. \r\n\r\nFor sure, me and many others developers feel deceived about this situation, because Flutter team PROMISED 60 fps animation! We all invest years of our lives in usage this technology, we spent our tech-reputation to push ours companies to take a risk and invest resources to achieve this technology. And what we have got from Flutter team? \r\n\r\nIndifference for the whole year! They decide to expand to the web and desktop, instead of contributing theirs main features and take care of community. That's why I tell, that \"quantity over quality\"\r\n\r\nAnd you are really think that is the Apple's problem? If you decide to create cross-platform system you had better to being ready for changes from each contributed platforms, a specially from a such moody company as Apple. \r\n",

        "body": "I think we're starting to get a bit off topic here.\r\n\r\nVery briefly, the need for shader compilation has to do with Flutter allowing you to dynamically create lots of different pixel configurations on the GPU. In theory, one could try to write a lot of that logic itself as a shader program, compile that \"uber shader\" once, and then never suffer from shader compilation jank during application run. In practice, that's extremely difficult to do correctly and may not even be possible to do performantly - shaders want to be small, well defined programs typically, and supporting everything that Flutter can do with such a program (on all the GPUs we have to support) is a very large problem space. Caching smaller programs can help, but it is not an ideal solution since different GPU/OS/driver versions can cause cache misses. This could be a problem even on iOS, where different phone/iPad models and iOS versions are in use. There are other design possibilities being considered as well.\r\n\r\nAs I said, we're working to come up with an overall better solution for this, but it's not an easy problem to deal with. This is considered an important issue by the team. We welcome contributions here as well, whether it's a patch or design proposals/feedback.",

        "body": "@dnfield If I understand you well we should try to convert our page ui(scene) into an image and than try to paint it inside Flutter default warmup routine (https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/DefaultShaderWarmUp-class.html) am I correct in this assumption? Also for us the main issue is the the cupertino route page transition we have other animations but nothing is as important as the first few page transitions and they have issue with shader compilation, page transition shader is directly related with the content of this page, we should try to get the images of pages that user is going to see first and put them in warmup routine? Can you just confirm or deny my assumptions?  ",
