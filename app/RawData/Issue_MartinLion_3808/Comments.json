There is another matter also which how to determine the class label that I want to predict form my dataset using scikit-learn. But anyway this step supposed to be after loading the file itself. Not easy process at all.\n\nIs there any youtube tutorial about loading dataset (not iris which is everywhere or other famous. stuff). Video is easy than links  \n",

The answer is: this is not a problem that scikit-learn\nsolves, go see pandas if you have CSV, scikit-image if you have images,\ndatabase connectors (SQLAlchemy?) if you work on databases...\n\nI guess that we should have a sentence like this in the tutorial, where\nyou reference, with pointers.\n\nAs a side note, the kind of errors hit by the users on the thread of this\nissue (lack of basic knowledge of Python for instance) tells me that we\ncannot solve their problem.

In addition, pretending that the tutorial of\nscikit-learn is perfect in spite all the questions regarding loading the\nreal data (not the toy data as it is too easy to be imported comparing to\nthe real data) is something needs to be reconsidered, and this means that\nscikit-learn staff don't care about the name of scikit-learn at all.\n\nSecond, we can understand from your unsuitable way of talking that you\nalready forgot that  scikit-learn is a product, and we as users are\ncustomers, so either you or the staff of scikit-learn should respect all of\nus and thank us for any comment or bug fixing. This is the professional way\nof behavior. So I recommend you to think of your words before saying them. If\nyou are knowing the way of loading the real data and you'd like to help,\ndon't only say go see pandas, better you answer people's question nicely\nrather than hurting them with your words, but if you're simply not able to\ndo that, so keep quite.\n\nOn the other hand, regarding the question \"should we instead add as a\nsection in the tutorial here?\", I would like to say \"_YES_\", you or\nscikit-learn staff should add a section in the official tutorial about how\nto load your own data either CSV, or ARFF or text or whatever, as users are\ninterested to load their own data, this is very critical issue should be\nconsidered in the tutorial (not to be ignored). *If you rely on the user,\nthen what is your work? *\n\nNevertheless, for those who are still struggling with scikit-learn, I would\nlike to say, this is not the end of the world, and as I mentioned\npreviously, find another to tool make your life much easier. For this\nreason, and in order to save your time, I would like to recommend some\ntools to assist you in data mining procedures. For instance,  Waikato\nEnvironment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA),\nhttp://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/, last version is  WEKA 3-7-13, is a\ncollection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. WEKA\nallows you to use its schemes either from GUI or writing Java code, so its\nvery easy for non-programmers. Additional to WEKA, R is also an excellent\ntool for data mining stuff, you can also perform tasks of R from WEKA or\nvice versa. However, if you have a patience to design a prediction process\nmanually (drag/drop), RapidMiner is a great tool for this propose where you\ncan design a very nice flow to achieve your target.\n\nThanks David van Leeuwen for your support.\n\nGood luck in your analysis.\n\nCheers,\nMartin\n\n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/3808#issuecomment-160153930\n> .\n",

        "body": "Hey Martin,\n\nKindly don't be offended.\n\nHe did not criticize :) He, being one of the top contributors to scikit-learn has to make tough decisions as to what will go into our codebase and what will not, as a more verbose documentation or tutorial might not be preferable for a lot of people. Gael has in fact contributed a lot of user guides himself to scikit learn to help users.\n\nThe reason why he was opposing that addition to the tutorial was that there are multitude of ways in which users have their data stored and such a user guide on how to get the input data from all of them (a text file/csv file/database/zipped archive), is indeed out of scope for scikit learn, which is a machine learning library.\n\nThe most important thing to note here is that **it is very clearly explained by documentations of libraries which handle data, like numpy or pandas.**\n\nIt is expected from the user that he or she knows this! Since it seems to not be very clear, he suggests that we add a FAQ, pointing the user to such userguides, which are more elaborate than we could possibly get :)\n\nIt may appear that our tutorial could be a bit more elaborate on how the inputs are obtained. But the thing, in general, with userguides is that, it could _always_ be a little bit more elaborate, which makes us set a hard limit on how detailed our userguides can get, to help contain the userguide in a maintainable format :) If you think from that perspective, you yourself would understand our situation.\n\nAs this issue is open someone will indeed send a PR soon adding a nice FAQ entry and an example, maybe, which could help clarify your (or any other new user's) doubts on input formats.\n\nCheers!\n",

        "body": "Hello @MartinLion ,\n\nwe understand your eagerness to solve your problem, and your frustration when it is not solved.\n\nHowever, you seem quite misinformed about what is scikit-learn, how it works, and how the project is developed. Therefore, I would like to make some points clear for you. As you can see from\nhttp://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html, scikit-learn is a community effort that is developed by a team of volunteers, mostly on their free time. Ga\u00ebl is one of the creators of the project and its current leader:\nscikit-learn would certainly not be the same without his contribution (the same for other volunteers), and he certainly did not deserve your dismissive words.\n\nWhat I would like to emphasize is that there is no such thing as a scikit-learn \"product\", or scikit-learn \"staff\" (only a handful of people have worked full time on the project). You mention \"we as users are\ncustomers\", but how much are you paying for using scikit-learn? Despite the important development cost, users get scikit-learn for free (and of course that's how it's intended to be). In fact, the development of the project relies on a fragile alchemy: users' needs being a top priority for developers, and users reporting bugs and concerns in the most positive way. The kind of \"ranting\" that you wrote can be very discouraging for developers, who contribute their free time and their expertise just because they believe that scikit-learn is a useful tool for the community. Some prominent developers stopped contributing to open-source software precisely because of such \"customer-like attitude\" of a few people underlining only shortcomings, and dismissing the huge development efforts. Please try to see the bright side as well: you received advice and comments from a lot of people, I'm sure that there was something for you to learn out of it, even if it did not solve your problem. \n\nAlso, although users' needs are indeed a top priority of scikit-learn (it has an amazing documentation, of which most scientific Python packages can be jealous!), each software addresses a well-targeted niche of users, and it is just normal that scikit-learn cannot fit all users. For example, it is preferable to use scikit-learn with already a good knowledge of Scientific Python. So, I'm really glad that you found a\npackage that suited your needs better, but please also acknowledge the time and good will that people gave away when answering you.\n\nSo, folks, let's all show some good will and keep a constructive dialog.\nThat's how the project we love will keep on rocking!\n",

I do my scientific work in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) since a couple of years, and before that, in R, octave, c++/c (some 30 years in total).  The Julia ecosystem is quite dynamic, and it is all very exciting, but Python just has this very large ecosystem and very clean coding, which makes it very attractive to use for little side experiments.  This time I had to do some topic classification of (single sentence) text documents. \n\nNow there is an abundant choice of language technology tools in Python, and I believe that via [lda](https://pythonhosted.org/lda/index.html) I got to scikit-learn.  Great tutorials, lovely datasets and all, but I found it very difficult to find out how to organize my own data so that I could load this in.  Just now, I browsed through the user guide again to find the docs for \"load_files\", but I could't find an entry.  So a google search for \"sklearn.datasets.load_files\" got me there just now, and I happened to remember the particular module path from more painstaking searches yesterday (it is mentioned somewhere in a tutorial).  For me, the essential information would have been: \"Organize your data one document per file, one directory per class\"---more or less what's under the documentation for  [load_files](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_files.html).   This all makes perfect sense, but I come from a community where usual formats are \"one datapoint per line\", often with the class label on that line.  But having said all this, I am pretty impressed how the Python (text) community has standardized data representation, from what I've seen so far.  But perhaps because of the widely used standard data representation, this aspect has naturally less attention in documentation. \n\nAs a final note, whenever I try to teach students how to use some scientific tool set or another, I have to spend quite some time on \"how to import your data\".  Nobody likes to do it, it can be a lot of effort for what you potentially use only once, and is therefore always a difficult threshold. \n",

        "body": "@davidavdav \n\nI agree that loading data is a difficult and important thing. However, it is a domain-specific problem. You have a particular type of data. I have another. My data is medical images of brain activity. I can tell you how I organize my data and load them. I can even tell you that we have written a whole package about this, with its own documentation. But that will probably not help you.\n\nWhat you want is something that tells you how to organize and load _your_ data. Now, it may be that your data is something fairly classic, that many people have; for instance tabular data most often stored in CSV files. In which case there is a need for a package doing this data loading. I don't believe that it should be in scikit-learn. It needs to be in a package that is specialized for this data. For instance, we are not going to put image processing in scikit-learn. For tabular data, the dedicated package is pandas; as I mentioned in my reply we need to point to it. We, the scikit-learn team, want to make plugin pandas into scikit-learn easier. But it is not as easy as it may seem and it takes time (one of our core devs is prototyping something).\n\nI realize rereading your post that your data is most likely text documents. So my two examples of data (medical images and tabular data) were both wrong :$. Maybe the documentation on processing text with scikit-learn could indeed be improved and touch a bit on data organization. I don't know, I very seldom process text. But if you want to do add a few words on this, you are most welcomed to do a pull request. Anyhow, this illustrate my point about the diversity of the data: this whole thread is mostly about loading CSV files, as can be seen from earlier comments (before the thread exploded into a rant). The important thing is not the \"CSV\", which is the container, but the data model that underlies a CSV file. This data model is that of columns of data with different nature. It's a very different data model than processing text documents.\n\nAnd finally, you are unhappy that teaching people \"how to import your data\" is time consuming. I don't think that there is an easy fix for this, even in a specific domain. The reason being that data meaning (ie data semantics) is still very much an open area. It's intrinsically hard to describe what the data means and how it's organized. You can try a simple experience: grab a dataset from someone you don't know, about an experiment you don't know, and try understanding it. Not even loading it, just understanding it. I am sure that it will take time. What takes a human time tends to be very difficult for a computer.\n",
