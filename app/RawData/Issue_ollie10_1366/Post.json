    "body": "Hi, I'm stuck on this problem\r\n**.Net Core 3.1 Web App** with a page that uses **Google Maps Autocomplete** and I need to save the address and coordinates (**Latitude / Longitude as decimals**).\r\n\r\nCreating an **object in javascript** and sending it to the controller via **jQuery Ajax**.\r\n\r\nThe problem is the following:\r\n\r\n- I'm using the default **System.Text.Json** serializer / deserializer\r\n- The decimal values returned by **google Js** API are in this format: _**55.7539619**_ (for example)\r\n- I use a **route parameter to set statically the Culture** like site.com/spain/ for **es-ES** site.com/russia/ for **ru-RU**\r\n\r\nIn the controller all the other properties arrive correctly except the latitude and longitude which are **decimals**\r\n\r\nThe problem arises when a culture is being used and the number is not in the format of that culture in the way that the separator is comma (for Spain for example) and not the point (which is standard for javascript)\r\n\r\nSo i looked for some solutions but none of them seems solving completely the problem:\r\n\r\n- i could replace the dot with comma before sending but it won't work for US culture for example, and besides that I would lose precision\r\n\r\nIn Newtonsoft Json there was the possibility to specify the Culture as options of the serializer but System.Text.Json doesn't have a property like that.\r\nI think that System.Text.Json should deserialize Json in the correct format more than 'interpreting' the culture\r\n\r\nThis is the code I'm using:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\npropertyToSave.OtherProp = 'text' // arrives correctly as all the other properties\r\npropertyToSave.Latitude = selectedPlace.geometry.location.lat(); //val: 55.7539619\r\npropertyToSave.Longitude = selectedPlace.geometry.location.lng();// val: 37.60819619999995\r\n\r\n$.ajax({\r\n\turl: \"/\" + countryInfo.EnglishName.toLowerCase() + \"/submit\",\r\n\tdataType: \"json\",\r\n\tmethod: \"POST\",\r\n\tdata: { property: propertyToSave, __RequestVerificationToken: $(\"input[name=__RequestVerificationToken]\").val() },\r\n\t....\r\n```\r\nI specify that if i replace dots with commas the values arrive correctly to the controller, in any other case the **properties are always 0**\r\n\r\nAny suggestion? Is a known problem? I suppose the Web API should suffer of this problem too",
