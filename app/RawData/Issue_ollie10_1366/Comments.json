        "body": "> The decimal values returned by google Js API are in this format: 55.7539619 (for example)\r\n\r\nJavaScript, and thus most use of JSON, doesn't do `decimal` (base-10 floating point), it uses `double` (base-2 floating point).  This (probably) won't solve your problem, but it does mean that values that are transferred may not always be what you expect.\r\n\r\n> I use a route parameter to set statically the Culture like site.com/spain/ for es-ES site.com/russia/ for ru-RU\r\n\r\nThere's multiple problems with this, besides the one you're experiencing.  The biggest one is that individual countries can have multiple major languages; Spain, for example, has Catalan (`ca-ES`), Canada has Quebec-French (`fr-CA` - there can be some pretty big penalties for ignoring this one, by the way), etc.  It also ignores things like user preferences for display language.  It's use in a route may be dubious (it's difficult to tell what else you're doing with it) - if I'm looking at houses/apartments/whatever in Russia, does that mean the page suddenly renders in Russian?  That won't be helpful if I'm trying to book a vacation there...\r\n\r\nIf the user is logged in, respect whatever language they have selected in their profile.  If they're not, use the [`Accept-Language` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language), if set.  Otherwise, take a guess based on IP range.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n>I specify that if i replace dots with commas the values arrive correctly to the controller, in any other case the properties are always 0\r\n\r\nSimply replacing the period with a comma would actually make it invalid JSON (since the comma is the attribute separator), so I'm suspicious that it works at all.  Your client-side code isn't what we'd be interested in - we'd need to see your controller code.  As it is, [in a trivial example I cannot reproduce your issue](https://dotnetfiddle.net/EvEKi5).\r\n\r\n(personally, I've always disliked relying on `CurrentCulture`, and would rather explicitly use a culture object for just those items that require it)",

        "body": "Hello again @eiriktsarpalis @danmoseley @layomia, I was double-checking the issue and seems is not solved.\r\nI mean the solution of the converter works properly, but I just realized I was terribly wrong, I'm **not** sending data posting a JSON from jQuery, but it's been sent via a normal post form via jQuery so the deserializer doesn't enter the equation, in fact the method _Read(ref Utf8JsonReader reader, Type typeToConvert, JsonSerializerOptions options)_ is never been called when the controller needs to bind the posted form to the object\r\n\r\nSo I further investigated to send the object as a JSON but without any success: the **[FromBody]** annotation in the controller it doesn't work in my case (don't know if I'm doing something wrong) but even if it would work then I would have another problem: sending the **object as JSON** and sending the **__RequestVerificationToken** as a normal POST parameter to pass the check **[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]**\r\nAs far as I know, I cannot send some objects as JSON and some as normal POST parameters in the same ajax call, so I don't see it an option.\r\n\r\nThe curious thing is that I realized that a normal post would work if the thread culture is set in **en-US** which is not my case as I mentioned you before, I have a custom **RequestCultureProvider** that map the route **/panama/ to es-PA**, **/dominicana/ to es-DO** and so on.\r\n\r\nBut the big problem which I think is causing a lot of headaches is that I don't have a way to change the culture to interpret the values in a specified culture, what I can eventually do is passing the **Accept-Language** header in the call specifying the culture and in this way the way numbers are red.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$.ajax({\r\n\turl: 'url',\r\n\tdata: { property: propertyToSave, __RequestVerificationToken: $('input[name=__RequestVerificationToken]').first().val() },\r\n\ttimeout: DEFAULT_AJAX_TIMEOUT,\r\n\tdataType: 'json', // this is what I'm expecting from the server not the format is sent\r\n\tmethod: 'POST',\r\n\tbeforeSend: function (request) {\r\n\t\trequest.setRequestHeader('Accept-Language', 'en-US');\r\n\t},\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did it so but is not working, my question is: the framework shouldn't take this into account in order to bind objects instead of other things? This can cause a lot of troubles, for example, imagine if you have an application which doesn't set any culture on an American server which provides content to a browser which doesn't have the same culture.\r\n\r\nIn my case I'm setting it manually from the routing but if you don't do it so, it can take the one of the server or the browser depending on how it's configured and can cause a lot of troubles...\r\nDon't know if you see my point",
