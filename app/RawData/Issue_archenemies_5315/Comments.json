What about the other questions I asked? You don't think any of your documentation needs to be fixed? Can you point me to the place in the documentation where you say which of lpadmin/lpoptions/PPD solutions is expected to make the printer work correctly with all CUPS clients? Who takes responsibility when other projects don't know how to interface correctly with your software?\r\n\r\nCan you give the HP people a hint on how the HP filter would need to be modified so that it respects the `lpadmin` setting not just with Evince print jobs but also with jobs submitted by Okular and `lp`? Or how can Okular be modified so that it prints correctly on inkjets?\r\n\r\nIs there another brand of inkjet printers, which works correctly with CUPS?\r\n\r\nWhat about cups-pdf, I've noticed that when printing to the virtual PDF printer then `lp` doesn't respect the lpadmin setting, Evince doesn't respect the lpoptions setting, and Okular doesn't respect either. Is that still an HP problem? Are you ever grateful to receive bug reports about your project?\r\n",
