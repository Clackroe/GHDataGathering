    "body": "I have an HP Photosmart Plus B210a which prints pages face up. I am trying to figure out how to configure Cups to print documents so that I don't have to reverse them by hand when they come out of the printer.\r\n\r\nI found [a discussion on linuxquestions.org](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/ubuntu-63/can-i-set-the-cups-output-order-to-always-print-in-reverse-order-746843/) which summarizes a recommended fix:\r\n\r\n     Add the line\r\n     *DefaultOutputOrder: \"reverse\"\r\n     to the file\r\n     /etc/cups/ppd/PrinterName.ppd\r\n\r\nI have tried this with varying results. I printed twelve two-page documents to try to investigate what is happening. I tried printing via the `lp` command, via Evince and via Okular. I tried using a ppd file with and without the `DefaultOutputOrder` line, and I also tried specifying a default output order with `lpoptions` of \"reverse\" or \"normal\":\r\n\r\n    lpoptions -dHP_Photosmart_Plus_B210a -o outputorder=reverse\r\n    ...\r\n    lpoptions -dHP_Photosmart_Plus_B210a -o outputorder=normal\r\n\r\nThe results:\r\n\r\n* `lp`: Ignores ppd line, honors lpoptions setting\r\n* Evince: Ignores lpoptions setting, honors ppd\r\n* Okular: Ignores both lpoptions and ppd\r\n\r\nAs with the reporter of #1679, I would have expected the PPD which is downloaded by default for my printer to give the \"correct\" behavior by default, which is to say, not requiring me to manually reverse long documents when they come out of the printer.\r\n\r\nI also tried the solution of #1679, using\r\n\r\n    lpadmin -p printer -o outputorder-default=reverse\r\n    lpadmin -p printer -o outputorder-default=normal\r\n\r\nThis setting was honored by Evince but not by `lp` or Okular.\r\n\r\nOkular's print dialog allows the user to change the ouput ordering, but Evince's print dialog, which appears more \"standard\" to me, says \"Page Ordering: Not available\".\r\n\r\nThere was some mention of all documents going through `pstops` as a final filter. If this is true then it should be possible for Cups to give users a single point at which to configure output ordering, which works uniformly across all applications which might submit print jobs to Cups. In either case it should be documented what is the preferred way to deal with face-up printers.\r\n\r\nI humbly offer my suggestion that for \"outputorder=reverse\" to work intuitively as a per-job option, then it should interact with the per-printer option as a parity bit, e.g. reverse+reverse=normal, rather than as an \"override\" (reverse+reverse=reverse). In my experimentation it seems to be the latter, and I think this should be documented because it is somewhat different from the way that other options like \"page-ranges\" work. If I write a script to print the odd pages in order and then the even pages in reverse, I feel I should be able to get the same result (manual duplex) regardless of the printer model. In any case where the `lp` man page says:\r\n\r\n      -o outputorder=reverse\r\n          Prints pages in reverse order.\r\n\r\nI think it maybe should say something like:\r\n\r\n      -o outputorder=(reverse|normal)\r\n          Overrides printer output-order setting for this job. With\r\n          \"outputorder=reverse\", document will be reversed on\r\n          face-down printers, and correctly ordered on face-up\r\n          printers; and vice-versa for \"outputorder=normal\".\r\n\r\nHere is my PPD file in case it helps: [HP_Photosmart_Plus_B210a.ppd](https://github.com/apple/cups/files/2010726/HP_Photosmart_Plus_B210a.ppd.txt)\r\n",
