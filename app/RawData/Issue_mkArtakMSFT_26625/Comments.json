As a result if you look `JSR 168` or `JSR 286` or `JSR-351` or `JSR-375` Multi-tenants, [Group to roles, or to claims](https://javaee.github.io/security-spec/spec/jsr375-spec.html#_group_to_role_mapping) vice versa is so easy vs. NET , mobile devices, portals, they all work seamlessly and cohesively with security fixes managed by either IBM or SalesForce or Oracle or Red Hat etc. This is enables developer to be productive right out of the gate.\r\n\r\nIn .Net there is void/very limited support, always requiring a combination of 3rd parties as a barrier to entry & adoption of ASP app. This is non-trivial for developers and security vulnerability that requires the attention of Microsoft Experts.\r\n\r\nExample: We have private information sharing site non OSS for the community almost free (pay if you want), and when we started with web forms, then Simple Membership, the Identity, Identity 2 ASP MVC we had implement much of it on top of these from scratch, when we moved to .NET Core it was another effort. Besides the development there was a lot of confusion on the internal concepts and how they now meant new things. Roles, Claims, Federation, SAML then SAML 2.0 and then Open ID 2.\r\n\r\nDescribe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n- A drop-in is extensible solution that supports ASP Identity eco-system, Administration, UI, SSO, Token, Multi-tenant Management\r\n- A configuration section to turn on-off the various features.\r\n- Embedded into VS Templates (remove Identity Server, use native MS option etc.)\r\n- Allow-Easy AD Active Directory Integration\r\n- `User Defined/Created Fields UDF` from the Admin level Support.\r\n- The current options and the pricing eliminate many of the existing applications from continuing usage on the .NET stack without extensive retooling or completely abandoning the MS framework.\r\n-  SAML2/CAS [per](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/26625#issuecomment-710908106) @tbonham\r\n-  Allow template option `Configuration.MultiTenancy.IsEnabled = true;` [Global DataFilter for Tenant entities](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/27006#issue-723795948)\r\n\r\nIts high time MS address this core gate-keeping feature!!",

Choosing what issues need solving based on community votes is why I never leave MS product feedback/bug reports anymore - if you don't have a social following or plenty of co-workers to upvote your issues they just languish and eventually get closed.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to select topics / general directions that the project can move in, let people pick from those, and let that guide part of the overall effort, without making specific commitments to specific issues.
