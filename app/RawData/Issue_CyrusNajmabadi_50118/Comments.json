I came up with this Obsolete workaround to allow VB to use important libraries such as System.Text.Json, and it worked. All we need is to read the rsf types, not to copy or box them in any way. We can stick to that and hold responsible for any outcome. \r\nI see no benefits of denying VB access to new .NET core APIs that use ref structs. I found a cheap workaround, but seems @CyrusNajmabadi  wants to put money and effort to take it out of our hands. This seems a loose/loose situation for the team and VB devs, and serves no purpose at all except sending a repeated message that VB is being deliberately killed, otherwise, why it only gets changes when it is not of favor of anyone? \r\nI think VB will do much better if you left it as is. No more damage please.\r\nThanks.",
