Flutter still used OpenGL on all iOS devices a few months ago so its performance would not be too far behind. Depending on the workload, your app may prefer trading Metal's other improvements for OpenGL's vastly faster shader warm-up performance.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, compiling the Flutter engine takes much more time than just clicking a button, turn on a flag, or running a single command. We could have made it much easier by providing an opt-out-Metal option (https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/61045). However, we don't know if that will bring more harm than good. That's why your feedback is valuable to us, and we'd love to hear feedback from as many app developers as possible.",
