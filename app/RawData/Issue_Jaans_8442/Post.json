Some of these require elevated / administrative permissions in order to function correctly.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to have some profiles **always** run with elevated / administrative permissions. \r\nAlternatively, a less ideal solution is for the entire Windows Terminal application to support configuration to start with administrative permissions. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\nIdeal would be to configure - at profile level - that it must elevate.  E.g. an additional property in the profile.\r\n\r\nIf it is only viable to start the entire Windows Terminal application with elevated permissions, then there seems behaviours coming from Windows Store Apps that prevent the traditional method of ensuring an application always starts with elevated prompt.\r\n\r\nNormally applications can be configured to automatically elevate at start-up by configuring it with either a shortcut and the relevant shortcut settings, or my using my preferred method which is via Compatibility Settings.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that applications delivered as Windows Store Apps do not offer the same capability or shortcut. You can manually right-click and \"Run as Administrator\", but not set it as a default start up.\r\n",
