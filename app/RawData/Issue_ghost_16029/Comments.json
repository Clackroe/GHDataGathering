I also donate almost double my Unity subscription to Godot, I know most of that money will not be used for C# development... and I'm 100% happy with that.\r\n\r\nI've been using Unity since the 1.x days. I tried switching to Godot a couple of years ago and found it impractical to do so but am finding it pretty easy to do so now. What is finally enabling me to switch completely over to Godot? Despite it being a great engine now and also with a lot of promise in the future, the largest thing that is making the transition possible is C# :)\r\n\r\nI agree with @reduz, I think you're interpreting the issue list wrong.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that you're assuming that:\r\n\r\n1) That no new C++ contributors are here because of C#\r\n2) That C# issues have increased, but the new contributors are unable to fix these issues, thus the core team members must pick up the slack\r\n3) The newcomers to Godot who use C# don't contribute to non-C# issues.\r\n\r\nEvery one of these points can easily be proven false and I think you'll see that the momentum of Godot is only going to increase due to C# being a standard part of the engine. :)",
