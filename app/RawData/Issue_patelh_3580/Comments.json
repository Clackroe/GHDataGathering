As we explained to you earlier, our team spends time on both projects: our open-source solution and our Enterprise solution, Gatling FrontLine.\r\nThe way we decided to split our R&D is as follows: Everything related to Gatling itself, like new support protocols, will be open-sourced (eg. HTTP/2, closed workload model and new feeders features in our latest release); On the other hand, everything related to reporting and automation features is in the scope of Gatling FrontLine. Please note that our Enterprise version helps develop both projects and have a team of 7 full-time employees. We hope you understand.\r\nAnyway, we would gladly continue this talk with you, feel free to contact us directly. We will now close this thread.\r\nBest regards",
