A idea that was good 10 or even 30\nyears ago may be just as good today.  Ideas are good or bad because\nthey're good or bad, not because they're new or old.  To think that\na new idea is better than an old one simply because it is new is\nfoolish.\n\n> It literally takes less than 30 minutes to learn git. That's no excuse.\n\nThat's not true, either.  While basic git operations are reasonably\nstraightforward, anything beyond the basics is horribly obscure and\ninconsistent.  To paraphrase Jamie Zawinski's comment about regular\nexpressions:\n\n    Some people, when confronted with a problem, think \"I know,\n    I'll use git.\"  Now they have two problems.\n\nAnd of course:  https://xkcd.com/1597/\n\nRegards,\nGary\n\n",
