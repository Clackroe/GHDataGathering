For them, `pip install tensorflow` fails as no wheel matches the tags expected by their environment (to debug, `pip debug --verbose` shows only tags that don't math the filenames of our wheels).\r\n\r\nThere is some requests to support 32 bits, see for example #31431 \r\n\r\nThis is not going to be easy as we need to also compile the C++ codebase in 32 bits mode and that would cause issues with code written assuming types have a certain bit width.\r\n\r\nThere is no change in the user visible API, just a new set of wheels to support more users.\r\n\r\nOpening this to reference in all similar issues.",
