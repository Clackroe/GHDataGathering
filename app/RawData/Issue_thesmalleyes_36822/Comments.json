Even if it seems a relatively high number, it is currently not that high (we are already at build number 200 after 18 months of release cycles).\r\nIt's also important to pay attention when switching back to appbundle, as the build number needs to go above the highest build number already released.\r\nSwitching back and forth multiple times between these two modes is not trivial.\r\nFor this reason we have currently decided to release fat apks with binary code for both architectures, accepting a 8MB overhead in the size, hoping to see this bug solved soon.",
