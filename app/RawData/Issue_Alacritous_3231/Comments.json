        "body": "@Alacritous thanks for _not_ including those invectives. \ud83d\ude05 \r\n\r\nWe're working on the documentation around \"dynamic profiles,\" but until that lands:\r\n\r\nThere's a fine line we're walking between dynamic and user-generated content. Most of the dynamic generators are for system-dependent things like \"what WSL distributions do you have\" and \"which versions of powershell core are installed?\". Each distribution gets its own profile, as will each powershell version.\r\n\r\nWe want to make sure they're _found_, but also that the user is clued into the fact that they can be customized. To that end, we add a \"stub\" entry to your settings file. _When we can't find it,_ we assume it's because the generator never ran or discovered new content (like: a WSL distribution was installed) rather than that the user removed it. \r\n\r\nWith just the one settings file as a single source of truth, we aren't storing a bit somewhere saying \"we already generated `{aaaa}`, don't do it again\" anywhere but the actual profiles list.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, you've got two options for disabling this profile (and any other dynamic/automatic profiles).\r\n\r\n1. Hide the profile, live with it being in your settings, and continue to let us know that you're not happy that it's there. Set `hidden` to `false`, and it'll stop cluttering up your profile list and key bindings.\r\n\r\n2. _Disable the whole dynamic generator_. We have three dynamic profile generators today:\r\n  * `Windows.Terminal.Azure`\r\n  * `Windows.Terminal.Wsl`\r\n  * `Windows.Terminal.PowershellCore`\r\n\r\nIf you add one of these names (or all of them!) to a new array at the top level of your settings file called `disabledProfileSources`, like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"defaultProfile\": \"{abcd}\",\r\n    \"disabledProfileSources\": [\r\n        \"Windows.Terminal.Azure\"\r\n    ],\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe generator won't even run and the profile will never come back.",

I was experimenting and just to see what would happen, I removed the PowerShell profile from the profiles.json file to see if it would come back too.

You represent your organisation, and my criticism is directed at your organisation. This isn't the first time Microsoft is forcing \"good ideas\" down my throat - if it was, I'd be happy to ask you about them directly, but this is just another data-point in a long history of similarly user-hostile actions. \r\n\r\nHaving said all that, this \"feature\" is an exceptionally bad idea, that breaks all conventions of software and user interface design. Moreover, the initial impression from a user perspective is \"this is broken. I performed an action, and now this action is undone.\" There is no universe in which this is OK, and if the decisions on this project stop with you and your PM, I'd strongly recommend you both find some additional learning on this subject. \r\n\r\nFrom a software design perspective, there are many possible ways in which you could have chosen to ensure your configuation generation component works together, this one is exceptionally poor.\r\n\r\n> We want to make sure they're found, but also that the user is clued into the fact that they can be customized\r\n\r\nThe irony of this statement is significant. You are literally clueing the user in to the opposite. \"I performed a customisation, and it is undone. This doesn't appear to be customisable\"\r\n\r\nFinally, it is a very safe assumption to make that the user of this software is somewhat technical. I sincerely hope that your persona's don't include \"Rob is a greengrocer, and uses his computer to browse the web and do his accounts for his shop. Rob also plays a game from time to time. Rob als has the strong desire to download custom alpha shell/terminal software to pimp up his command prompt\". In other words, your target users can safely be assumed to be a bit more technical leaning. At the end of the day, you are expecting the user to edit a JSON file manually to modify settings.\r\n\r\nIn the context of the more technical user it would also be safe to assume that that when a piece of your default config (that ships with your package) has gone, and that this is a user action. \r\n\r\nAs I said, the motivation for this misfeature (it comes across as an ad in disguise) is flimsy at best., and doesn't give the impression that this project has the benefit of some adult supervision from time to time.

        "body": "Hey, so we spent a good deal of time trying to come up with a solution to a hard set of problems. We want to cover cases like \"what happens when a dynamic profile generator doesn't always create the same list of profiles\" and \"what if a user wants to use the same settings file on two PCs with _different_ WSL distros installed\"? We wanted to make it robust, so that it would fail in the fewest possible cases. Software though is about compromises - there's not an effective way for us to dynamically generate a profile then _have the user delete that profile entirely_, and know to not delete it again. There's not a practical different between the profile not existing _because we haven't generated it_ and not existing _because the user deleted it_.\r\n\r\nYou're right that our userbase is a technical audience, which is why we expected them to be able to <!--rub two brain cells together, and-->take the four seconds it takes to read the synthesized JSON, see the `\"hidden\": false` that we stick in there, and think \"hmm, maybe that hides the profile \ud83e\udd14\".\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to read more about how we came to the conclusions on this design that we did, I'd encourage reading #1258, where we originally designed the settings model, and especially #1321, which is a changelist specifically relating to dynamic profile generation.\r\n\r\nWe're looking towards the future here, towards a scenario where users largely _aren't_ having to modify their settings files by hand, and can just use the UI for that. In that future world, all the intricacies of how dynamic profiles are implemented won't actually be exposed to the user - they'll just delete the profile in the UI, and we'll mark it as `hidden` for them.",
