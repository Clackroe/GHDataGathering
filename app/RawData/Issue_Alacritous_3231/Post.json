Remove the section for Azure Cloud Shell completely including the surrounding brackets and comma preceding the first curly bracket.  leaving the file valid but missing the Azure option. I have no need for it. \r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect to be able to remove the option that I do not have any use for. \r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhen the Windows Terminal Program is run, the profile segment that was removed reappears as if by magic much to my amazement. \r\nIf I mark the file as read-only to protect it from being reverted, Windows Terminal refuses to load. \r\n\r\nI literally watched the section in question reappear in the configuration file open in VS code after I deleted it saved the file and re-run the Terminal program. \r\n\r\nI want very much to include several invectives and expletives in this bug report. But I will refrain from doing so. \r\nBut I want you to imagine what I would have said and you be sure and be creative. \r\n\r\nThe following is the text that I remove from the configuration file that reappears when the Windows Terminal program is run. There is no error or notification. It just reappears and the option for Azure Cloud is on the menu. \r\n\r\n<----------- begin relevent text ----------->\r\n,\r\n        {\r\n            \"guid\": \"{b453ae62-4e3d-5e58-b989-0a998ec441b8}\",\r\n            \"hidden\": false,\r\n            \"name\": \"Azure Cloud Shell\",\r\n            \"source\": \"Windows.Terminal.Azure\"\r\n        }\r\n<----------- end relevent text ----------->",
