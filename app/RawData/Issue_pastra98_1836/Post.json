I want to switch to the new terminal app, but every time I open a new linux terminal, it starts out in my windows system 32 directory, whereas I would like it to start where my repositories are located. Using the terminal that's provided with the ubuntu for windows app, I simply made a new shortcut, that starts in my desired location. Any way to do this with the new app?\r\n**tldr: start new linux terminal at a specific directory instead of /mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32**\r\nsorry if this is the wrong place to ask this.\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nDescribe why and how a user would use this new functionality (if applicable).\r\n-->\r\nThe json offers the option to specify a starting directory for both powershell and cmd. If possible, it would be awesome to have that same option for a new bash instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\n-->\r\n",
