However, this deprecation warning also seems to be issued when a bare **boolean** variable is being used in a conditional. \r\n\r\nLet's look at an example included in ansible's own documentation:  https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html#the-when-statement\r\n```\r\nvars:\r\n  epic: true\r\ntasks:\r\n    - shell: echo \"This certainly is epic!\"\r\n       when: epic\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy is this triggering the deprecation warning?   This warning will cause a tremendous amount of work for the ansible community... that is, tons of playbooks will need to be rewritten that have conditionals checking bare booleans.  (for example, adding the | bool filter to make the warning go away)  Wouldn't it make sense to only have the deprecation warning pop out when it's a naked string variable is being evaluated, and not have the warning for a naked boolean variable?",

Most role maintainers will simply give in, and add a \" | bool\" filter, even though using the | bool filter on a boolean is just silly.
