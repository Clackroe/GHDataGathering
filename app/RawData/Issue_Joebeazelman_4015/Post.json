    "body": "I just wasted several hours trying to figure out why my site wasn't working. First, I got a 500.32 \"ANCM Failed to Load dll\" server error code. This wasted several hours of my time trying to work through the suggested troubleshooting tips (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/troubleshoot-azure-iis?view=aspnetcore-3.1).  The doc said it was most likely due to binary incompatibility so I tried to use the **dotnet** command to find out what's installed. When I typed  **dotnet --list-sdks** or  **dotnet --version** I got the following error message:\r\n\r\n> The specified SDK version [3.1.100] from global.json [D:\\****] not found; install specified SDK version\r\n> Did you mean to run dotnet SDK commands? Please install dotnet SDK from:\r\n>   http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=798306&clcid=0x409\r\n\r\nI reinstalled the SDK and received the same error.  Why is **dotnet** giving me this error for no apparent reason?  This was getting me no closer to the solving the problem until I realized that I should restart the web server and perhaps my app will work again.  Lo and behold it was a simple restart!  This is the second or third time I've been screwed over by Microsoft's shitty installation practices. You guys suck at everything!\r\n\r\nWTF Microsoft!  Can't you guys get anything done without turning it into a nightmare?  You force the user to restart the computer when they uninstall a server bundle, but you don't require them to restart IIS when they install a server bundle?  I would be tempted to blame legalization for this kind of mishap, but you guys have always sucked at software!  Everything you guys put your hands on sucks!  Windows sucks and now you even made .NET, your crown jewels, suck!  Microsoft should grow turnips instead of writing software!",
