The grass isn't greener on the other side...\r\n> \r\n> // +10 year Java master & former frequent linux user\r\n\r\nIf you're comparing the development products of one of the largest corporations in the world to those developed by volunteers, then you've made my point better than I have. I have over 25 years of development experience from 80x86 to C++ on many different platforms and the grass has always been greener! During the 1990s, we had Think C and Metrowerks CodeWarrior on the Macintosh which were far more productive and pleasant than what we even have today. Microsoft was at least smart enough to incorporate those features into VB and Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's development tools have never been great, but just \"good enough.\" The trend over the past years, however, has been a downward spiral. Visual Studio has become unbearably slow no matter how much computing resources you throw at it.  The documentation is a labyrinth of dead ends full of outdated information and broken links. Microsoft is no longer vested in providing useful and productive GUI-based development tools. They're leaving it to the open source \"community\" who believe in UNIX's user-hostile CLIs and configuration files are the only way to go, hence VS Code.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has never had much of a vision. It's like a fat, old Elvis who still rides on its monopolistic past. As the PC fades as the primary computing platform, so will Microsoft. Apple, a company left for dead back in the late 1990s, has leapfrogged Microsoft through product excellence. Apple dominates the mobile platform, while Microsoft failed spectacularly in the mobile market and the internet.  Even Microsoft's own top developers, including Miguel de Icaza, are shamelessly seen using MacBook Pros. That speaks volumes about Microsoft's quality.\r\n\r\nSo I guess I need to be smoking the same grass you're smoking in order to medicate my way out of seeing Microsoft's mediocrity?  No thanks! ",
