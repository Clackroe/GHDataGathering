In #8682 @KrauseFx mentioned that:\r\n> Mh, I don't think that's gonna work, as all Ruby files are already loaded at that point by bundler. You'd have to run bundle update after importing the file, which is not something fastlane can do on its own as far as I know.\r\n\r\nWhat about `fastlane_require`? It could be used to install a plugin gem - not sure whether it contradicts a _Gemfile_ or what other steps are needed.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if this is not possible, can we add a note in `import_from_git` [description](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/import_from_git/) with reasoning if any?\r\nMaybe it would be great to add a warning when `import_from_git` detects a _Pluginfile_ to remind that plugins should be installed/updated. I think it would follow _fastlane philosophy_.\r\n\r\nOr _fastlane_require_plugin_ could be added in order to fail if there is no entry with a provided plugin name in a project _Pluginfile_?\r\n\r\n2. If this can be done then maybe someone is already working on it? Maybe _fastlane community_ could help?\r\nIn #7636 @lacostej tried to discuss an idea to solve this but with no answer. Any chance to do this in this thread?\r\n\r\n#### Motivation Behind Feature\r\n<!-- Why should this feature be implemented? What problem does it solve? -->\r\nUpdating a _shared Fastfile_ with usage of a plugin requires an update in a _Pluginfile_ in each project importing this _Fastfile_ (or also in a _Gemfile_ if plugins were not used before). This is a bit inconvenient and not a safe way of introducing changes.\r\n\r\n`import_from_git` should import a fully configured, standalone _shared Fastfile_ with all dependencies defined there and/or other files.\r\n\r\n#### Alternatives or Workarounds\r\n<!-- Describe alternatives or workarounds you are currently using -->\r\n<!-- Are there ways to do this with existing actions and plugins? -->\r\nIn #11112 @NiklasWebnuts proposed an interesting workaround.\r\n",
