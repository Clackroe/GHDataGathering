That would effectively \"force-install\" a plugin when your imported `Fastfile` is used. Would that solve your problem?",

It would change files on the file system and also\r\n\r\nProbably that would still not work? When running fastlane command via `bundle exec` no other gem can be loaded as _bundler_ disallows loading gems that are not in the bundle. So when `import_from_git` is called in _fastlane_ runtime, _bundler_ runtime environment has already been created and won't allow any other gems to be loaded.\r\n\r\nHowever, the only solution that comes to my mind, to make it work with _bundler_, would be to nest another call to `bundle exec` but with a temporary _Gemfile_ (it can be passed like that: `BUNDLE_GEMFILE=PATH_TO_TEMP/Gemfile bundle exec some_command`). This temporary _Gemfile_ would include all the entries from a _project_ _Gemfile_/_Pluginfile_ and all the entries from an _imported_ _Gemfile_/_Pluginfile_ (as _Gemfile_ is actually calling `eval_gemfile` on a _Pluginfile_ so it is like those entries would be in a _Gemfile_). No modification of a current _Gemfile_ or any other file is needed.\r\n\r\nBut this is  **not a good** idea ;), and it would only work if `import_from_git` was at the beginning of a _Fastfile_ - it would be the most convenient to just call `bundle_exec` with the same command and parameters as the original one.\r\nOne caveat of it is that it nests with each `import_from_git` call over and over again...\r\nThe other one is that if `import_from_git` is not placed at the top of a _Fastfile_ it means some lanes or anything else might already been executed and would require to somehow reuse this _fastlane_ state in a new `bundle exec` call...\r\nTerrible idea that is why I am hiding it in the details \ud83d\ude03 \r\n</details>\r\n\r\nSo I guess it **cannot** be done due to usage of _bundler_.\r\n**But** if one is **not using** _bundler_ in a project (and hence both _Gemfile_ and _Pluginfile_), then they could just add plugins via `fastlane_require` action in a project _Fastfile_ or in an imported _Fastfile_.\r\nThis can be done in the current version of _fastlane_ and it works.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n> > Anyway, if this is not possible, can we add a note in `import_from_git` [description](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/import_from_git/) with reasoning if any?\r\n> \r\n> Documentation of that actions says:\r\n> \r\n> > Import another Fastfile from a remote git repository to use its lanes\r\n> \r\n> That is pretty clear that this action is for importing `Fastfile`s.\r\n\r\nExactly, that is why I was surprised that it imports all the files of custom actions as well and not only a _Fastfile_ ;). It is not even mentioned. And as plugins are just actions this is probably why people think that remote plugins should be imported or actually expect them to be imported implicitly like in a case of custom actions.\r\nBesides, searching for issues regarding `import_from_git` and _Pluginfile_ yields a lot of results so it seems like it is not so obvious for people and they constantly ask to support _Pluginfile_ in `import_from_git`.\r\nHence, I think an explanation with a good reasoning would be welcomed.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n> > Maybe it would be great to add a warning when `import_from_git` detects a _Pluginfile_ to remind that plugins should be installed/updated. I think it would follow _fastlane philosophy_.\r\n> \r\n> What do you mean by that? How should this work?\r\n> \r\nWhat I meant is that when `import_from_git` detects a _remote_ _Pluginfile_ (meaning in the same directory as the _Fastfile_ it tries to import) it could print a warning listing the plugin names and saying that in order to use this _remote_ _Fastfile_ these plugins are required to be in a _local_ _Pluginfile_.\r\nIt could even compare a _local_ _Pluginfile_ with a remote one and throw an error when it detects that plugins from a remote are not included in the local one. It would be very informative and helpful.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n> > Or _fastlane_require_plugin_ could be added in order to fail if there is no entry with a provided plugin name in a project _Pluginfile_?\r\n> \r\n> Doesn't this already happen when you use an action of a plugin, that is not installed?\r\n> \r\nYes I know that calling a plugin action would end up with an error but a usage of such an action might be somewhere far down the lanes \ud83d\ude04  i.e. after a long build or anything else.\r\nI think it is better to prevent such a _Fastfile_ from running at all as it will almost certainly finish with an error - so why wait for that?\r\nThis is just another way of prevention I have described above. This time using a `fastlane_require_plugin` as an action in a _remote_ _Fastfile_.\r\nInstead of adding a _remote_ _Pluginfile_ (like in a case above and handle that _Pluginfile_ in `import_from_git`) you could specify directly in a _remote_ _Fastfile_ that some plugins are required via `fastlane_require_plugin` action - this would work like in a case above - check if these plugins are in a _local_ _Pluginfile_ and then throw an error if missing.\r\n\r\nBoth of these preventions of course make sense if one is using _bundler_, _Gemfile_ and _Pluginfile_. Otherwise it is enough to use the current `fastlane_require` action and it will install a particular plugin gem (if necessary) upon running any lane from such a _Fastfile_.\r\nSo now both usages are handled.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n> That being said: You can of course create an action in your shared `Fastfile` that does exactly what I described above. Download some file, edit `Pluginfile` (or create it if it doesn'T exist) or add it additionally to `Gemfile`, then run `bundle install` using the `sh()` action. That would effectively \"force-install\" a plugin when your imported `Fastfile` is used. Would that solve your problem?\r\n\r\nLike I said above, if I use _bundler_ it is almost impossible (see details at the top). If I don't use _bundler_ (and thus neither _Gemfile_ nor _Pluginfile_) I can just require my plugins via `fastlane_require` and they will be installed if necessary.\r\n\r\n",

It supposed to be a discussion so you can ask questions too. \ud83d\ude04 Otherwise, I cannot help you understand. If you do not follow - can you ask other collaborators for help?\r\n\r\nBy the way, I do not think spawning yet another issue on the same subject is going to help solve anything. Even more, I do not think that \"the actual problem\" I want to solve and \"a suggestion for the solution\" of this problem should be in separate threads?! \ud83d\ude31 What are you saying?\r\n",

You use a dependency manager to install the required dependencies and then run something that uses them, it would be weird for the thing you run to install dependencies for you.\r\n\r\nKnowing this, another way to improve this is what @Skoti already mentioned, and which I always love: automatically prevent incorrect usages. So the current options seems to be:\r\n1. Warn users (`UI.important`) when they `import_from_git` and a `Pluginfile` also exists in that remote.\r\n2. Create a separate action (`ensure_plugins`?) that ensures that all the required plugins (defined in the local and in the remote `Pluginfile`s) are available (could be \"harder\" because of [this](https://docs.fastlane.tools/create-action/#submitting-the-action-to-the-fastlane-main-repo))\r\n\r\nAnd as always, PRs welcome! \ud83d\ude03",

Even though maybe a comment by @janpio might have come across as rude, every fastlane contributor here does this in their free time to help other people. Time is limited, and spending time on other developer's issues is usually hard to justify. It's not cool you mentioned and tried to include a random set of other contributors in the hope they'd help out. As you can see, _fastlane_ is a highly active, and widely used open source project, and there is no possible way to reply to every single issue. I wrote about the problems of how difficult it is to scale open source communities over here https://krausefx.com/blog/scaling-open-source-communities",
