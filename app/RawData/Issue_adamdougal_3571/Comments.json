        "body": "@slandelle I am sorry but I don't really understand your reasoning, although I understand your concern around protecting the Enterprise value.\r\n\r\n Just to confirm, your strategy is to prefer for us to fork this project so that we can use a logger for a single line of code where you are currently using println, pushing us further away from wanting the Enterprise solution because you are classifying using a logger to output the summary as part of `stats/exports/integrations`, although that information is already being outputted in a different form?  \r\n\r\nTo be honest, this entire thread so far makes me far less inclined to introduce a dependency on the enterprise project.  I believe gatling is great as a project, I believe you should get paid to support and continue working on it full time, I also believe large companies should pay and help support opensource initiatives.   The problem is that I also believe your approach will alienate many people, or at least me and all the people I talk to about this.  It's a very simple code change, that actually makes it more consistent, as the majority of of your code base uses loggers (as any developer would expect). \r\n\r\nYou are not even arguing about not outputting that data because it's `stats/enterprise` data.  The data is there and available in the logs already!  The only difference is the primitive output mechanism.  The fact that many modern log shipping frameworks expect json/structured logs means that using println automatically makes you a less attractive product for both enterprise and non enterprise adopters.  These println statements just create noise in most modern log shipping frameworks I have worked with as they cannot be interpreted as a single event.  This is genuine feedback.\r\n\r\nI would urge you to reconsider the quick decision, because I believe this suggestion exposes no more information than you currently do, moves you towards a more standardized output like the rest of your code base, and would actually show you positively engaging in improving your entire product offering, OSS and Enterprise. \r\n\r\nThe functionality you are planning as part of Enterprise are still attractive to companies like ours, e.g. aggregation of metrics etc, grafana datasources etc.  I think you've convinced yourself that any improvements to OSS is a risk to Enterprise.  Just doesn't sit well with me.",

The points I was trying to articulate are that this request:\r\n\r\n- doesn't expose any data that would previously be inaccessible / enterprise.\r\n- doesn't suggest structuring the results in a way that is easier to parse/interpret programatically\r\n- only suggests what we believe is better practice by outputting using a logger which is the standard practice\r\n- would allow for common, modern log shippers to ship your output with our creating message noise, where each println is interpreted as a new log event.\r\n\r\nI literally don't see a single reason you would be against it this request.  I've read through your comments multiple times and I still don't see a single argument you have given explaining why . \r\n\r\n> Sorry, but all new features regarding stats (additional stats, pushing stats elsewhere) fall into the scope of FrontLine, our Enterprise version.\r\n\r\nFair enough to that statement, but we're not talking about additional stats, pushing stats or anything about stats.  We're talking about not using a logger for your output which causes problems when using industry standard shipping practices that expect structured logs.\r\n",
