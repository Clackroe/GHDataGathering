There are challenging trade-offs here.\r\n\r\nHowever, I really liked legacy conhost's solution to this -- if I have text selected, then Ctrl-C is copy just like windows.  And Ctrl-V is paste.  If I have no selected text, then CTRL-C is passed through to the application.  IMO, these should be the default settings.  They should be customizable, in case a user wants to change them.\r\n\r\n(On macOS its CMD-C and CMD-V, and I've bound those for Windows Terminal, but what really messes me up is that in every *other* app on Windows its CTRL. )\r\n\r\nTo be honest what I really wish is that I could change the rest of Windows to use ALT-C and ALT-V (or META-C and META-V) for copy/paste, which would not collide with most other uses but keep the control bindings available for terminal windows.  I do understand why that's not practical -- given the fact that each application manages it's own key bindings.\r\n\r\nAnother possible solution is to offer some extra modifier (e.g. SHIFT-CTRL-) that would send the control sequence to the application running in the window.  Even as a UNIX user, I know for a fact that I use CTRL-C and CTRL-V occasionally in the terminal to control my apps, but far less frequently than I use copy-paste.   So I'd prefer to require keyboard-twister in the uncommon case, and be able to use copy-paste like I do everywhere else by default.",

So since CTRL+C/CTRL+V were recently added to cmd.exe, I would've expected them to be passed down the shell and work as expected. \r\n\r\nIf you are using a different shell (PowerShell, Bash, etc), then I would expect they should be passed down to that shell for it to interpret as expected. \r\n\r\nI find it odd that Terminal is interpreting these keys instead of the shell currently in use. I would only expect Terminal to try to interpret any keys you have defined in the key-bindings. Otherwise yeah, they should just be interpreted by the shell in use, so as to provide consistency with what people expect in each shell.",
