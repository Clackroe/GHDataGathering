I'm one of the TLs of AngularDart, and let me make it clear I think web components are awesome, and would love Dart to support them well. The primary take away here is _well_ though, and that will take a little bit of effort, because the current HTML libraries and browser bindings aren't well suited for this.\r\n\r\nWe could probably get some _hacky_ support quicker, but it won't be something useful to most customers. It's something we'd like to revisit after Dart2 launches, but until then - again to be very honest - it's just not a priority. We care, but we have limited time and resources, and have to use them efficiently, like I'm sure you do on your project(s) and company.\r\n\r\nFWIW, most popular web frameworks are not utilizing web components today:\r\n* React\r\n* Vue\r\n* Angular (JS/TS/Dart)\r\n\r\n... so it's not clear web components is the \"killer\" feature for most people.\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience!",

        "body": "@eukreign:\r\n\r\n> The entire point of Web Components is that it's a \"framework\" that is built-in to browsers\r\n\r\nWell, sort of. It has [yet to be supported in Microsoft Edge](https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1), for example, which is quite a large market segment still, and the polyfill performs quite badly. So until it works everywhere, it's not free.\r\n\r\n> AngularDart emulates many features of Web Components, why does it do that instead of just using Web Components directly\r\n\r\nAngularDart (and JS/TS, and React, and Vue, and Ember) all were created before web components were a thing. A lot of these framework authors have evaluated web components and found them severely lacking. Here is [one of the leads of React](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QZxArgMwidgCrAbuSikcB2iBxkffH6w0YB0C1qCsuH0/edit), arguably the most popular framework today:\r\n\r\n> We\u2019re not going to use it at all at Facebook. We\u2019re not going to build React on it because there\u2019s a strong model difference \u2013 imperative in Web Components to declarative in React. Web Components doesn\u2019t have an idiomatic way to define things like where events go. How do you pass data when everything is a string? We see it more as an interop layer that lets various frameworks talk to each other.\r\n> \r\n> In talking to the Atom team, this doesn\u2019t solve different framework idioms as it doesn\u2019t have an opinion on how they relate.\r\n\r\nAgain, it's not that support will never be offered, but it's unlikely to happen in any immediate time frame. There are other APIs that are more useful for our users, like web workers, service workers, and more right now.\r\n\r\nFrom a _personal_ perspective (not the Dart team's), I'd use JavaScript or TypeScript if I was highly interested in web components - its much better suited for this lightweight model than Dart is (more suited for larger web applications, not scripts/standalone components/buttons).\r\n\r\nThanks for understanding!\r\n",
