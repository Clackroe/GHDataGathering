This effectively 'ends the task' from the controller's point of view even if it is still running on the target, this is kind of a 'de facto' increase in parallel tasks, but not from the perspective of the controller. \r\n\r\nIf the task is about changing the controller loop of tasks .. this HAS to be a locking (serialized) task, so even making it async, would just mean we don't wait for the result but would be LOCKED waiting for the queue being updated before we can proceed. At best 'async' include means we fire up EACH included task in async (w/o increase in forks nor parallelization) and don't wait for results (poll: 0?)  which means we won't know if the tasks succeeded or not (unless you introduce async_pol which then gets back to a limited sync to get results).",
