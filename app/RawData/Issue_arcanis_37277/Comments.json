To reiterate:\r\n\r\n**Yarn 1 isn't legacy**\r\n\r\nYarn 1, as it is, is fine.

It means that existing users won't get accidental regressions or bugs. **Yarn is about stability, and putting our users in control.** You shouldn't need to upgrade just because we release something new.\r\n\r\nYarn 2 is technologically better in many aspects. It would be easier for us to simply say that it should be the global binary at all time and that's it - similar to how npm is distributed. But different projects value different things, and in our case we care a lot about giving each user exactly the version they expect - whether it's Yarn 1, 2, 3, or 42. We care about it so much that we introduced a builtin feature for that three years ago, that we made it the default a year ago, and that we started the discussions around Corepack three months ago.\r\n\r\nOf course it means that not all users are necessarily on the latest release. That's fine! Because they already have a tool that solves their needs right now, and because we'll never break semantics by redefining existing fields or ranges - as that would negatively affect past users by forcing them to upgrade. Now, perhaps later their use case will evolve, they'll need better perfs, or to solve a particular bug, or to implement something on their own, and they'll upgrade to the latest release, which will keep receiving regular bugfixes and new features. But perhaps not, and that's fine, because they will still follow an explicitly supported use case.",

All versions of Yarn act both as a package manager and a jumper (similar, if you will, to `gulp-cli`). If it finds a `yarnPath` entry in `.yarnrc.yml`, it will use it instead of the global one. In other words, older projects will use Yarn 1 (because that's the global version used as fallback when nothing is found), or the checked-in package manager if it finds the right configuration to do so. Put simply, everyone gets what they ask for. There is no \"involuntarily upgrading users who are on an older version\". On the other hand, it does require *a* Yarn to be globally available.\r\n\r\n> I can understand where you're coming from here, but this sounds like a pitch to me. It feels like justification of decisions without crediting the potential trade-offs or drawbacks of those decisions.\r\n\r\nLet's be clear - you're telling *me* that I don't credit trade-offs or drawbacks, on a project I maintain, for a protocol that was designed a year ago, and for which noone has reported any automated breakage of any system, while still being able to migrate at the time of their choice. At this point I don't know what to tell you.\r\n\r\n> Is Corepack still progressing? If so, why are we considering this PR since Corepack would theoretically replace it?\r\n\r\n[That's answered](https://github.com/nodejs/node/discussions/37193#discussioncomment-332122).\r\n",

The last one which was, `2.0.0-rc.27` (out of 36), was only assigned to a `berry` tag. I'm positive no Yarn 2 user relies on a specific global version.\r\n\r\nAs for Yarn 1 users, past releases were semver-compliant, so 1.22.5 (the latest one) can installs the whole 1.x line. I would also point out that this wouldn't be any different from how npm releases work: you recently upgraded npm from 6 to 7, which is far riskier than Yarn 1.20 to 1.22 - at least semver-wise.",

Years ago it was Emacs v Vim, then Tabs v Space, and nowadays Yarn v npm. I feel the need to mention this, because studies have shown that those who oppose tend to be more vocal than those who support, especially when the opposition is the status quo.\r\n\r\nGiven that the primary goal (at least for me) is to help current users, not necessarily acquire new ones, I'd be wary of the survey wording. Specifically, I'd be cautious about not making it look like a \"two parties\" question. In my opinion, the survey would benefit by proving not only that a segment of the Node community would be positively impacted by this change, but also that even those who wouldn't directly benefit from it *wouldn't be negatively impacted* either.\r\n\r\nFor instance, rather than \"would you like it? Y/N/neutral\", which could incite non-Yarn users to answer N rather than neutral, perhaps a more suitable question would be \"would it benefit your workflows? Y/N; would it impede your workflows? Y/N\" (perhaps with a \"Why?\" box on each, to get testimonies on both sides). Basically focusing on the effects rather than the feelings. My 2 cents.\r\n\r\n(One last note in the meantime, @jasnell made an informal Twitter poll pretty much about this about a year ago; while the results are incomplete with only 378 answers, it can help set expectations and perhaps give ideas about wording: https://github.com/nodejs/node/discussions/15244#discussioncomment-99336)",

These kinds of bugs are complete show stoppers for some private registries. Shipping an unupdatable version of Yarn as an unchanging artifact in Node leaves Node permanently broken. Bugs happen, but there needs to be some process through which they can be fixed.\r\n\r\nIf this really was just a feature freeze, I would be less concerned, but as can be seen from the issue and associated PR, that's not how it's playing out on the ground.\r\n\r\nI would also add that the ecosystem needs to be able to add features to package management systems. Blessing a package manager that can't receive feature updates would reduce the ability for the Node community to adapt to changes. For instance, there's the open npm RFC to add registry dependencies -- if that lands in a way that's acceptable and adopted the major package managers still under development, it would be very uncomfortable for Node itself to be shipping with one that didn't support it.",

The RFC you're talking about has received strong objections from both Yarn and pnpm - objections which from what transpire from the issue don't plan to be addressed. In other words, npm being the only package manager is already putting the ecosystem at risk (at least under their current handling of RFCs).\r\n\r\nAlso note that this isn't a unique occurence - in fact, it already happened a few months ago with npm 7, which tried to change how peer dependencies are semantically defined. Just like now, the RFC received early and strong pushback from both Yarn and pnpm (and other projects), but the RFC author decided to ignore them and go with it.\r\n\r\nThe lack of package managers diversity (and thus neutrality) is a problem. The role of the Node TSC is to find a solution. This PR (along with others) is a way to do that. If you have a better one go for it? I don't mind seeing competing ideas.",

Even with the RFC process, npm's roadmap is still controlled by a singular commercial interest. Perhaps the better forum for such discussions would be the OpenJS Foundation, where a spec and reference implementation for such things could live while allowing competition on specific implementations. But... that's a separate conversation.\r\n\r\n@iarna does raise a valid point about ensuring that bugs that need to be fixed in the 1.x stream are fixed in 1.x. As I understand it, there's no intent on shipping yarn2 in core which means we cannot interpret \"fixed in 2\" as being meaningful here. @arcanis addresses that concern rather well [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node/discussions/37193#discussioncomment-341216). So long as there is a demonstrated commitment to ensuring that security and critical bug fixes are made, and that yarn1 remains functional/compatible with Node.js@latest, then I'm not sure what else can be said there that would be convincing. Specifically, no one has asserted that the yarn versions shipped in node.js would be \"unupdatable\".\r\n\r\nI would not expect Node.js to just accept that unquestioningly. I would expect Node.js to hold Yarn accountable to that promise that the issues would be addressed, and if it turns out the issues are not addressed and major bugs persist, then we would always have the option of removing yarn from the distribution.\r\n\r\n@iarna also said:\r\n> ...if that lands in a way that's acceptable and adopted the major package managers still under development, it would be very uncomfortable for Node itself to be shipping with one that didn't support it.\r\n\r\nBut that's not the case here. Node.js would not just be shipping a single package manager option that did not support the feature, it would continue shipping multiple package manager options. It would be up to users to determine what they want to use -- and whether support for that new feature is important to them or not. The users would give us the necessary feedback to determine which is the right path. That said, it would be rather unfriendly to the ecosystem as a whole for a single package manager run by a singular commercial interest to unilaterally ship a new feature that would qualify as a \"must support\" by others.",
