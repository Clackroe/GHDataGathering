    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\ni need to manipulate HTTP requests before they are sent; i want no manipulate the whole request (headers, data) and i think, all this could be possible starting here at the docs: https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/package-http_http/BaseClient-class.html\r\n\r\nIs it possible? I think.\r\n\r\nBut for getting **raw** response as string/byte[] to extract all needed details, where should i start? I am not sure. I want to work with the response like a normal response and i want to work besides with all headers of this response to check exactly whats in - not consumed already, only **raw response string/byte[]**\r\n\r\nCan you give me the right starting points?",
