    "body": "I've been spending WAY too much time on adding bootstrap 4 with npm to a webpack project. In hope to save others the time, I thought i'll share the final recipe -\r\n\r\nstart by installing bootstrap in your project -\r\n```\r\nnpm install bootstrap@4.0.0-alpha.6 --save\r\n```\r\n(notice bootstrap has two dependencies - jquery and tether. If you would rather have explicit versions of those two, you should install them as well)\r\n\r\nimport bootstrap's javascript through index.js -\r\n```javascript\r\nimport 'bootstrap';\r\n```\r\n(i'm assuming you're using es6, in case of es5, use `require('bootstrap')`)\r\n\r\nThe previous line will only import the js part of bootstrap. for the styling part you have two options -\r\n\r\n### 1. Precompiled SASS\r\nInside one of your sass files (index.scss for example) add this line -\r\n```SASS\r\n@import \"~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss\";\r\n```\r\n(notice the ~ (tilde) which points to the node modules folder)\r\nThis mehtod is beneficial if you plan on using your own version of the wonderful __variables_ file bootstrap comes with. just make sure you import __variables_ before _bootstrap_. Also, now you can use all the cool mixins bootstrap has.\r\n\r\n### 2. Compiled CSS only\r\nIf you're not planning on using the variables or the mixins, and prefer the precooked css file, simply add this line to index.js or any other js file -\r\n```javascript\r\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';\r\n```\r\n(btw - you can also import this way the sass file, but it's nicer to import it via another sass file as shown in pervious mehtod)\r\n\r\nnow comes the webpack part. for _jquery_ and _tether_ to be available as a global variable throughout the project, you'll have to add this to your webpack plugins sections -\r\n```javascript\r\nnew webpack.ProvidePlugin({ // inject ES5 modules as global vars\r\n  $: 'jquery',\r\n  jQuery: 'jquery',\r\n  'window.jQuery': 'jquery',\r\n  Tether: 'tether'\r\n})\r\n```\r\nThe different jquery definition are meant to answer requirements of different libraries (for example angular looks for 'window.jQuery'). I'm assuming your webpack.config already has rules for scss and/or css.\r\n\r\nAnd that's it! now you have bootstrap in your webpack project.\r\nLet me know if any further explanation is needed, and if anyone knows of a better way, please share.",
