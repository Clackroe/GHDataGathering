Im very polite as it possible with MS brand.

Dear creorive,

I would like to leave you some words, I do mean to end the discussion and not advance it.

There will be a Windows store entry for early adopters sometime this summer. And the release date is set for this Winter.

They advertised this for developers to thinker and contribute, not for anyone to just press a build file or use an installer.

By enabling the current barrier you ensure that the people who are using it have the skills to do so the right way. And therefore are able to contribute correctly.

If there was a simple build file or installer, I, an everyday Joe, will thinker with it and I may screw things up on my computer or make excessive issues on this GitHub. (I would say, one like this.)

So i am convinced that this is the perfect way to tease this product. Mind you that this is a release but not a Launch of the product. This is like an alpha, not representative of the final product and thus not finished.

Would you complain the same way if Valve gave away the source for HL3 but wont give you an installer? No, you should be happy with what you got.

If you are un-able to build this yourself or find it too much of a hassle, this product is probably not made for you. (Sorry)

But I doubt that since I could get this to work and I dont know what i am doing.

I hope this gives you a different perspective on the discussion.

-Jasper

PS: if you really want to have an easy way to install this, fork it, fix it, make a pull request and contribute.

You're referencing that picture of a tweet, right?  The tweet posted by Windows **Developer**?  The Twitter account primarily followed by developers?  The one that says "Microsoft Developer is your resource for development tips, tricks, research, case studies...Everything you need to develop apps that users love."?   The tweet I'm assuming is targeted towards developers, not standard users?

You're talking about that one, right? 

Even then, my only real question to you is this:
