Won't happen, the the people who code vscode are too scared to go against someone's beliefs. They removed a god damn hat for fucks sake, a hat that's related to a holiday that isn't celebrated for its religious symbolism anymore, the latter was issue for the amazing mastermind who made #87268. This is why we can't have nice things. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 1
