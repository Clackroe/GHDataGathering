Can you run this little app I've created, while Code is running?  [rust-playground.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/1947172/rust-playground.zip)

It will output all running process numbers and names. Something like this:

Any thoughts on who might be preventing that deletion? Just to confirm, the setup runs elevated, correct? Does the `inno-updater.exe` process also run elevated? +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM4 +++$+++ SP4851889 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM3 +++$+++ 2018-04-25T14:45:45Z +++$+++ Well, there are at least two pieces of security software running on my machine: ESET Security and CrowdStrike Falcon (though CrowdStrike is a recent addition, and I think this issue was present before it was installed), neither of which I have any control over. There are also various other controls in place as this is a managed Enterprise installation of Windows. I have co-workers that use Code without issue though so I doubt it's those. My guess was more along the lines of zombie processes spawned by Code that were still holding some resource.

A quick check in the task manager shows that all three update processes (inno_updater.exe, CodeSetup-insider-guid.exe, and CodeSetup-insider-guid.tmp) are elevated. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

My current thinking is that `inno_updater.exe` actually wouldn't run as elevated, even though it would be spawned from an elevated process. Which is something I clearly can't repro:

I'm pinging all of you since you all reported the same error `Access is denied`. I want to ask you to try to reproduce it, so we get more info from it.

In order to reproduce it, close Code, open the `C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\resources\app\product.json` and change the `commit` field to `outdated`. Start Code, you should get an update flow. If the issue reproduces and you get the dialog which asks you to send us the log file, please do the following:

1. Open [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/)
2. Enable the `Elevation`, `Integrity` and `Command line` columns in Process Hacker
3. Search for any `Code.exe` processes running. If they are running, copy the full command line of each and show me.
4. Check what is the elevation and integrity of the `inno_updater.exe`, does it match its parent?

3. I followed all installation steps, then went to the path you mentioned. Here is what I see:
