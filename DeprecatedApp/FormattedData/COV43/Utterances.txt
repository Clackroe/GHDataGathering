I'm waiting for a [kubernetes](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://git.k8s.io/community/community-membership.md#member) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes).

Internally, there are several ways to detect dead connections. For example: error on `readLoop`, connection idle timeout .. etc.

Most of detections kick-in during the `readLoop` except the one referred here.  The http2 Transport health check will kick-in when the `readLoop` is completely idle for `ReadIdleTimeout` seconds. 
It aims to do an additional health check when there is no incoming traffic for amount of time, but before `IdleConnTimeout` triggers idle connection recycling.
Thus, I think the `ReadIdleTimeout ` should be smaller than `IdleConnTimeout` to achieve it's designed purpose.

In addition, I suggest keep the minimum `PingTimeout` value to default 15s. 
[From the source code in golang.org/x/net/http2/transport.go](https://github.com/golang/net/blob/08b38378de702b893ee869b94b32f833e2933bd2/http2/transport.go#L1806-L1816), It uses `time.AfterFunc()`, not `time.Ticker()`, to trigger health check, and only `Reset()` the timer when the next `readLoop` kicks-in.
It means that the health check will be performed ONLY ONCE when the `readLoop` blocks for amout of time. In such situation, there should be only one PingFrame on the fly, so the `PingTimeout` does not matter much.
But setting the `PingTimeout` too low (eg: 2s in this PR) may lead to incorrect connection recycling during a network jitter or system load spike.

Meanwhile, as the wide acceptance of http2, Kubernetes may have more additional default http2 Transport options to apply in the future. I suggest making a independent and well-commented helper function for the future configuration.

What I described above has already been done in my PR https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95898
Please consider my solution against this PR.

@povsister I'm open to any reasonable suggestions, and I also want to share my opinions:
First of all, I do think users should not care much about the http2 health check, and it's not something Kubernetes even want users to notice, therefore I still suggest to set it by some reasonable default values. Besides, in your ‘proud’ PR, the http2 Transport `ReadIdleTimeout` is configured as the half of http Transport `IdleConnTimeout`, Is this reasonable and not nasty?
Secondly, there's never a 'law' against the PR which needs rebase and squash. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

COM24 +++$+++ SP12867714 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM23 +++$+++ 2020-10-28T13:22:01Z +++$+++ @JensErat @aojea Since there is no need for uses to configure http2 health check, I do think we should add http2 health check by some reasonable default values, and if you guys think pingTimeout=2s is two short, we can tune it larger, maybe default 15s is a good option.
Besides I can't find any significance that setting http2 Transport ReadIdleTimeout as the half of http Transport IdleConnTimeout, Is there any relationship between these two configurations? 
PR #95898 looks pretty but unnecessary, again, I insist my way to fix this problem, which is no doubt the most simple and efficient approach to this problem.
And I don't care about which PR will be merged finally, but I do care about the most reasonable solution for this problem.
If you guys could give reasons for setting http2 Transport ReadIdleTimeout as the half of http Transport IdleConnTimeout instead of some reasonable defaults, I'll be happy to close this PR ASAP. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
