First of all, if I remember correctly, the marketplace had this thing on every extension's page:

![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2685357/25901135/734e34fc-359e-11e7-8a0b-a4ee9171ef4c.png)

So I've added an analogous message to all of my extensions' readme files, and I think other extension authors have done this too.

I have an extension called [Todo+](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus) (full id: `fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus`). This is what happens when the command `ext install vscode-todo-plus` is executed:

- `vscode-todo-plus` in an exact match of the id minus my username, and the extension is not even in the top 10 results.
- Searching for `fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus`, which is an exact match of the full id, leads to the same results.
- Searching for `@id:fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus` works, **but only inside VSC**, it doesn't work on [marketplace.visualstudio.com](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com)
- Where are these `ext install` and `@id:` commands documented anyway?

Let's try to search for another extension of mine, [Open in Browsers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-open-in-browsers) (full id: `fabiospampinato.vscode-open-in-browsers`):

<img width="1102" alt="screen shot 2018-02-03 at 16 51 16" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1812093/35768894-f918c7e0-0902-11e8-8876-8386a2c52078.png">

- Not only `vscode-open-in-browsers` is an exact match of the extention id minus my username, but "Open in Browsers" is the extension's title, and "vscode" is practically a meaningless keyword, as is "in". What's the first result for this search? [vscode-ins-support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wk-j.vscode-ins-support) 😕

I hope we do agree there's a problem here.

If I may suggest a few improvements: 

1. Always check if an extension's id (minus the username) is an exact match of the current query.
2. Implement [stop words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words).

Disregarding the fact that the Marketplace doesn't return any results when searching for an extension's id, we have fixed the Marketplace instructions since a while. `ext install` was our way of guiding users to install extensions inside VS Code. Since we now have URL handlers for Mac and Windows, those instructions became almost irrelevant. We now only show them for Linux users:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22350/35850126-1510cbaa-0b24-11e8-88da-f21d798b53b3.png)

Running this in VS Code will correctly trigger the search for `@id.name`. The `name` format should've never been there. Only the`id.name` is unequivocal in order to find an extension in the Marketplace.

One idea I have for alleviating this pain is to improve the `ext install name` (without `id`) experience: what if we showed in quick open a list of extensions which match that name? This would simply mitigate the fact that there are instructions for `ext install name` out there. But in any case, I recommend switching your instructions to `ext install id.name`.

I would have replaced those `ext install (...)` instructions with URL handlers, but I've tried them once and after that, for a few days/weeks, a "Do you want to install (...)" message kept popping up every time I opened a new window. By the time that was fixed I guess I had forgotten about them.

While searching an extension, we also take into account the community inputs like number of downloads, number of ratings and average rating along with the string matching. Among the string matching, exact string matches carry a higher weight than prefix match. 

Since `node_modules` is one word in your extension name, word `node` in search text gets prefix match here. However, there are lot of extensions on Marketplace which have exact word 'node' in their extension name. So they carry a higher weight for matching the word 'node'. Additionally, since your extension is new, download count and ratings of other extensions are way higher, pushing their total score to the top.

One way to improve your extension rank is to break word `node_modules` into separate words `node modules`. This will increase the string matching score and push your extension up in the result. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM9 +++$+++ SP1812093 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM8 +++$+++ 2018-05-28T15:38:02Z +++$+++ @gaurav42 Well, I would still consider whatever algorithm you guys are using broken because if I search for "open in node modules" I get these search results (some samples ~~randomly picked):

| Rank    | Ext. Name    | Ext. Description | My comments  |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| `#6`  | [Node Exec](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miramac.vscode-exec-node) | Execute the current file or your selected code with node.js. | 80k downloads, but no mention of "open" or "module(s)" anywhere.
| `#10` | [CSS Modules](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=clinyong.vscode-css-modules) | Visual Studio Code extension for CSS Modules | 22k downloads, but no mention of "open" or "node" anywhere.
| `#17` | [Node TDD](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=prashaantt.node-tdd) | Ease test-driven development in Node and JavaScript | 9k downloads, no mention of "module(s)", but at least it has a few "opened" in its readme.
| `#64` | [Open in Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jonsmithers.open-in-vim) | Opens current file in vim | 2k downloads, this is not even mentioning "node" anywhere, let alone "module(s)". But at least it has "open" and "in" in it's title.
| `#65` | [Open in node_modules](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-open-in-node-modules) | Open the current selection or arbitrary string in node_modules. | 2 downloads, it matches all the provided keywords, **in its title**.

If I had to guess what's wrong with your approach I'd say:

- Lack of stopwords, kind of meaningless keywords like "vscode" or "in" are given too much weight.
- Poor query parsing, if keywords are joined in some sort or another the whole thing falls apart (vscode-foo-bar, foo_bar, GitLens etc.)
- Maybe you're giving too much weight to downloads and ratings, the first thing to sort for is relevancy.

> One way to improve your extension rank is to break word node_modules into separate words node modules. This will increase the string matching score and push your extension up in the result.

I'm not going to rename the extension to something wrong (`node_modules` is a folder, I'm not talking about `node modules`, as in "NPM packages", here) just to work around this. +++$+++ 4 +++$+++ 0

Some examples (when searching for "python"):

Py Files generator is above autoDocString, despite having about 50k less installs and 0 reviews
Same thing with ladieratheme - it is above autoDocString despite having about 49k less installs and 3 less reviews

Trustcode odo snippets and kvlang is above docker linter, despite having 47k less installs

Python paste and indent has 3 stars but apparently it's 2k extra downloads trumps Python (pydev)'s 5 star rating.  Seems like download count is weighted more heavily than rating in the ranking (or maybe python paste and indent has better keywords)

Python Coding Conventions has 773 downloads and is unrated, yet somehow is above magicpython (with 742 _thousand_ downloads and 3.5 stars) and several other extensions with far more downloads / good ratings.  So you could have a very popular or well-rated extension but if you don't have the right keywords you will still be ranked down.

Wait..,. but looking at the Python Coding Conventions package.json, it doesn't even have any keywords!

> While searching an extension, we also take into account the community inputs like number of downloads, 

You mean the download count that is _also_ the update count?  This has been a outstanding issue ever since 2016 - when you release an update the marketplace shows your downloads as having increased.
The update count should not effect the search ranking.

> number of ratings and average rating 

That's good, but what algorithim are you using to calculate the weighted rating?  Not sure if that is open source but hopefully it isn't something like RatingA - RatingB or RatingA/RatingB

This probably happens because of this:

> You mean the download count that is also the update count? This has been a outstanding issue ever since 2016 - when you release an update the marketplace shows your downloads as having increased.

Yeah that's another major problem, one could automatically push a new update every day and downloads will go through the roof even though the same number of people are using it.

I guess technically those users are _downloading_ the update, but once this things are counted the downloads counter becomes less meaningful. 

The download counter for extensions on Chrome's store decreases when somebody uninstalls your extension and I think it doesn't increase just because the extension gets updated. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

When searching for "line endings" (picture below)<br>
The following 4 circles are all similar extensions. The red circles have MORE downloads, installs, and better ratings, and I checked the `package.json` all of them have "line endings" in the title and as keywords.<br>

How can 'Line Note' (4th result) which
- doesn't have 'endings' in the title
- has 203 downloads
- no reviews
- doesn't even have 'endings' in the package.json or readme 

Beat out both 'line-endings' and 'code-eol (2019) Line Endings'
- both contain the full search term in the title
- they have 4K and 6K downloads respectively
- they have 4 stars and 5 stars respectively
-  and have 'line endings', 'line', 'endings' in the keywords of the package.json and readme

And it's not like 'Line Note' is some anomaly, there are 25 just as bad results that come before the relevant one.
