COM5 +++$+++ SP20648924 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM4 +++$+++ 2019-10-27T18:45:29Z +++$+++ The reason this can be closed is because the issue has been fixed on our development environment. We don't need open issues for something that is fixed. I just verified that it is fixed locally. I'm not sure when the next time the code will be added to the live site will be; but once it is added, you will be able to submit your projects normally. Thanks.

If not, then the problem is likely login issues, discussed further [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/37457).

If yes and you can change your settings, submit other challenges and everything, aside from project submission, seems to be working, then this is definitely something new. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

Our landing page looks like the log out version of /learn at the moment. It is likely that you have been redirected to the landing page without getting logged out.
