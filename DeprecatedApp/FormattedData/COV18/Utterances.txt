The current issue with DSX is about proper integration with Flutter tools as to provide a great developer experience with debugger, auto-complete, etc. working on .dsx files.

Telling users that they can use DSX but can't use debugger or enjoy auto-complete is a non starter for me. If anybody wants to help, what I need is to figure out a way to add full preprocessing support (with source map) to Dart Tools and VS Code Dart plug in. Once the tools support that DSX or any other transpiling language (any language that is a superset of Dart but compiles everything down to Dart) would just work.

If you can and would like to help, let me know.

The format of XML is very simple so when you see '{}' you know it is calculating an expression in dart.

But why only for some of the properties? And how do you handle cases where there's two child slots, like ListItem? XML-ish syntax just doesn't seem to handle this very well.

Also I'm not really sure it's less boilerplate.

Compare:
```xml

It's not at all clear to me that the XML-ish syntax is cleaner or less boilerplatey. There's lots more punctuation, and some duplication of content (e.g. in the close tags). And you had to add some names, so sure, you lose "child", but you gain "name" on Icon.

Also with XML how do you make it clear that Row can take zero, one, or more than one child, while Center has to have exactly one child? What would happen if someone did this?:

```xml
   <Center> <Test/> <Test/> </Center>

They wouldn't need to fully parse Dart if we had a Dart parsing API either, though, right? I mean, you'd parse what you want to parse and leave the rest. Also I'm not sure it's actually easier to parse, since it's not actually XML; see below.

> but it also makes reading the code easier. 

I'm not at all convinced that the XMLy version here is easier to read. Once you've read a few build functions, you quickly get used to the nested constructor syntax.

> The format of XML is very simple so when you see '{}' you know it is calculating an expression in dart.

It's not actually XML, though, right? It's some variant of XML. Are there well-defined parsing rules for it? For example, is this valid?

```xml
  <Test name={describe("}")}>
```

How does it know that the first "}" isn't the end of the attribute expression, without parsing Dart?

> Same for the opposite, when reading dart code and you see '<Capital' (a less-than followed by a word that is capitalized. example \<Row>) you know that an object hierarchy is being created from XML markup.

You know this today when you see the `new` keyword too, right? Or indeed in the new-less markup proposal above when you see any capitalised word. Is this really a benefit of XML, or are you more familiar with XML than Dart?

I really don't understand what you're proposing here. It's not well-formed XML at all as far as I can tell. Can you elaborate on exactly what the syntax you are proposing is and how it works?

If you are really interested in learning why JSX is hot, just google for "react tutorial" and notice that for the past 2 years all articles on React use JSX.

You failed to grasp that XML parsing (with some extra code to skip '{}' properly) is orders of magnitude simpler than fully parsing a programming language like Dart. That is a fact.

----

I've no doubt that JSX is "hot". In React, the non-JSX syntax is a lot worse than the alternative syntax proposed in this issue (the one that looks like our current code but without the "new" and "const" keywords). What I'm trying to understand is whether the same reasons that JSX is "hot" in React apply to Flutter.

Regarding TypeScript doing JSX, In 2012 I was involved in efforts to specify [E4H](http://www.hixie.ch/specs/e4h/strawman), and even before that there was [E4X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript_for_XML). Both efforts died. So it's important to me that we understand what exactly it is people like about JSX vs other syntaxes.

Parsing XML isn't easy, parsing sort-of-XML-but-with-curly-braces-somehow is not easy either. Parsing sort-of-XML-but-with-curly-braces-somehow-that-is-embedded-in-another-language is even less easy. However, how easy that is to implement probably isn't a big deal because it's going to be implemented once or twice and then the library that does it will be reused. (I've been heavily involved in writing the specs for parsing HTML and been involved in similar work for XML, and I've implemented a parser for Dart, so I have a pretty good idea of how difficult parsing markup languages vs programming languages actually is.)

It's pretty obvious when scrolling through Flutter apps where the build functions are (they're the giant nested expressions). What is it about "declarative markup" that is important to separate from "code"?

As far as I can tell, JSX doesn't handle the things I was asking about. For example, React doesn't have the concept of child slots. The closest thing I could find is something they do by switching back to JS then back to JSX inside that, so you'd need to be able to parse both the programming language and the markup language. +++$+++ 14 +++$+++ 0

Yes, the exact same thing applies here. The current way looks good to you because that's the only option you have. Give people a second option and the same will happen. 

Whether E4X died or not is irrelevant because nothing lives forever. I have used ActionScript with E4X a lot and thought that Adobe did an excellent job there. In a way Flutter is just a newer version of Adobe Flash with Flex apps.

Code readability and simplicity which in turn drives a whole bunch of other benefits.

On your giant nested expressions can you easily see structure? can this structure be easily manipulated by other tools like GUI builders interchangebly ? I mean like Adobe Flex Builder use to do, drag and drop widgets around, wire them on UI and then switch to code view and just edit anything you want and then switch back to gui mode and continue to manipulate the widgets. You can't do that easily when the programmer goes inside your "giant nested expressions" and writes any valid dart code that doesn't follow the structure that the GUI editor is expecting. With a fixed XML structure that is not a problem.

> As far as I can tell, JSX doesn't handle the things I was asking about. For example, React doesn't have the concept of child slots

It handles it just fine, you just don't know how to do it. So going forward just put the example in question here and I will provide you with what I think the JSX version should be.
 
```dart
  new ListTile(
    title: new Text('CineArts at the Empire',
        style: new TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.w500, fontSize: 20.0)),
    subtitle: new Text('85 W Portal Ave'),
    leading: new Icon(
      Icons.theaters,
      color: Colors.blue[500],
    ),
  ),
```
```dart
  <ListTile>
    <title> 
      <Text style={{fontWeight: FontWeight.w500, fontSize: 20.0}}>
         CineArts at the Empire
      </Text>
    </title>
    <subtitle>
      <Text>85 W Portal Ave</Text>
    </subtitle>
    <leading>
      <Icon data={Icons.theaters} color={Colors.blue[500]}/>
    </leading>
  </ListTile>,
```

It looks longer than the dart version but I could had placed everything in the same number of lines. Thing is an IDE/Editor can provide '+' & '-' to expand and collapse these XML nodes anyways.

Make Flutter look familiar to React developers and you have a chance of attracting a bunch of new users to Flutter.

Whether it died isn't the issue, it's why it died. Did it die because it didn't provide a solution that people wanted? Did it die because of implementation issues? Did it die because of patent issues? Was it too early? Too late? I think it's important to learn lessons from past experiences. Why did E4X and E4H fail where JSX has succeeded?

What I find interesting is that people who are new to Flutter often ask for two things: a markup language, and animated GIFs. Then three months in, they are still asking for animated GIFs, but not for a markup language. It could be that this is because the markup language isn't actually needed once you're used to writing build methods in Dart. It could be that they still want a markup language but have worked around the omission and so don't think to ask anymore. It's worth figuring out which because otherwise we risk spending effort on something that is the wrong choice (in either direction).

> On your giant nested expressions can you easily see structure?

Yes, at least as easily as with XML. Personally, I find XML to be very verbose and it obfuscates the structure. But I think this is more about what you're used to.

(We're also experimenting with IDEs that put in [virtual "closing tag" comments](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/383#issuecomment-321985929) for you so you can see the structure without having to actually write it.)

> Great so you know that parsing a markup language is trivial compared to parsing an imperative programming language.

My experience is that declarative vs imperative is not the distinction that matters when it comes to determining how easy a language is to parse. (For example, HTML is "declarative" but it may be among the most complicated languages to parse that I've ever dealt with.)

> Code readability and simplicity which in turn drives a whole bunch of other benefits.

If this is the main benefit then this is something we can test. We could take a mixture of engineers who are used to writing HTML, React, iOS code, Android code, Flutter, command-line apps, and so on, and present them each with various syntaxes, and ask them to describe what they think the resulting UI would look like. We can then measure which syntax gets the best results. @InMatrix is this something we could look at after the animation work wraps up, maybe?

> can this structure be easily manipulated by other tools like GUI builders interchangebly ?

Yes, in principle at least. It should be relatively straight-forward to mechanically convert Dart expressions to XML or JSON or whatever other structured language one might use. It's just a matter of converting the syntax, the actual information is the same. Personally I wouldn't convert it to a different syntax if I was making a GUI editor, I would just parse it into a data structure in memory straight from Dart.

> You can't do that easily when the programmer goes inside your "giant nested expressions" and writes any valid dart code that doesn't follow the structure that the GUI editor is expecting. With a fixed XML structure that is not a problem.

The thing is, you can put exactly the same "any valid dart code" in the XML structure as in the Dart expression. They are literally mechanically interchangeable. So I don't really see how using XML helps with this particularly. For example how would you turn this into XML?:

```dart
new ListView.builder(
  padding: new EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
  itemExtent: 20.0,
  itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
    return new Text('entry $index');
  },
)
```

I understand the appeal of markup for defining UIs however I can also remember some drawbacks:

- Flex application visuals could be defined in terms of markup and code. As I remember it, code tended to dominate in large real-world apps.  Readability isn't necessarily a benefit for apps defined as a complex hybrids of markup and code.
- The "Flex Builder" IDE had to support apps that were defined by  markup and code. This made the IDE difficult to build and maintain. Developers tended to view it as an ActionScript tool.
- Evolving and maintaining the XML "compiler" was a significant burden that kept a team of engineers busy full-time.  Keeping the compiler and toolkit in lockstep slowed down the evolution of the overall sdk.

It died because E4X was only implemented in ActionScript which was only used inside Adobe Flash/Flex and Adobe killed the project. Instead Adobe changed direction towards open standards where there is no single source provider with possibility of lock-in and ecosystem implosion.

Sure you can do that go ahead, I am sure you will find out that "Once you do React(with JSX) you simply don't go back". Survey experienced React developers and ask them if they think JSX is bad and it should never had been done. Show your way and ask them if they want to replace JSX with what you have. Before you do that, close the doors and lock up the place because these developers are just going to grab their stuff and sprint for the closest exit.

Yes, but I often switched from design view to code view and vice-versa.
Starting a screen I would go to design view and use drag/drop to layout widgets and generate first static screen. Then I would add in code and some static data to fill in screen so I could show people something running that looked like production ready stuff. Productivity was incredible. As development progressed, I connected the front end to the back end and the amount of ActionScript code grew and yes it dominated the code overall but even at close to release time, I often used the design view to tweak the UI without having to dig into code.

Not in today's world. Imperative languages have evolved in the philosophy of Python and are great for development. Declarative techniques with embedded markup (XML) became mainstream with the advent of React; and JSON became the preferred text based data format.

E4X was an ECMA standard. Mozilla shipped it for a while, but then removed it (a very unusual move for a browser vendor). Other browser vendors never wanted to implement it.

Indeed. This is an optional IDE feature, and one that you don't have to write into the code, which makes a big difference to whether the verbosity is an issue, though.

I have strong feelings that adding markup creating some challenges with GWT I'd hate to see another API go through. 

I've seen a couple other frameworks go through this transition regarding with UI building. Markup like this works great for tooling, in so far it's heavenly for the IDE developers. It's easier to separate the responsibilities of who does what. Although I think it can be done better. 

GWT started out this way, building UI's with Java. Then came along UiBinder, where you could build the UI in xml markup, with a specification. Then the tooling, Eclipse Plugin, was able to generate UI's in xml markup. Android is doing it too, no need to belabor the point. So what I saw happen, markup works great for UI IDE developers. But really, markup is a huge huge investment in time and added complexity tooling to transition it to real program. And the tooling is always last to come. So in the mean time, while all that manifests into reality, there are two worlds. Two interesting ways of doing everything. One in the default language and one in markup. So I support GWT today. When I write documentation, I have to write it twice, once for Java and once for UiBinder XML Markup. So the real question, if you want to go down the markup road, I think the question should be asked, is the added complexity worth the journey! 

JSX I think aims to solve other issues where you want to blend together what your doing with HTML and javascript. It really doesn't feel like the added complexity of markup specification suits the needs of writing UI with markup. Especially when you don't really have a document markup language as the target. At least not for the everyday user. 

On a positive note. I like to work on tooling. So I can see a markup language being quite useful. It's much easier to write and modify AST when your using markup.

But then again, if you have enough minds on the job, it doesn't really matter what you do. At the end of the day, if the developer can write his application faster with your api, your going to get traction. But at what cost to the engineering team. 

I think the real question is, how can the UI be built faster. I think tooling could write the dart, skip any middle man markup. And my aim isn't really to say it's not worth it, but really count the cost's on all the fronts if the road is taken!

**Here is the thing about React and JSX. Initially I completely dismissed it**, I was in love with Angular and doing massive work with Ember. I tried desperately to convince the team to go with Angular but that didn't go anywhere as others had their eyes on Aurelia. Someone pointed me to React, I read the docs and evaluated and simply said that there was nothing in there that Angular or others couldn't do it. Then last year I worked on a new project and had the chance to try something new so I gave React a try and **you really don't fully appreaciate what React brings to the table until you develop with it for awhile, then it becomes night and day against all other frameworks. It's a mixture of simplicity and expressiveness brought together by JSX.**

I would represent the \<List.builder> as a rectangle and if its child/children where other widgets I would put rectangles for that inside it.
Since the child in this case is a function, you can simply put a rectangle saying 'uneditable/code' to tell users that this widget is created from code or in this case easily deduce that the function is a shallow wrapper to the <Text> widget and simply present that; I mean a rectangle that says that the function is a shallow function wrapper and inside it the List item widget rectangle (\<Text> in this case).

All I am asking is to add these simple extensions on the Dart compiler so that if developers want to they can write using this XML structure. The old way would continue to work and the amount of work involved to do this is not huge at all. You can actually see how many lines of code it takes the babel.js compiler to do JSX and I am talking hundreds and not thousands of lines (I just checked it).

Absolutely, it's like the argument of whether you should train your developers with the latest techniques and risk them leaving your company. The bigger risk is keeping them around untrained. So you must adopt the latest techniques out there or risk being left behind.

React is leading the journey with the latest techniques to develop UI/UX. It has tremendous traction with developers. Your greatest risk is not meeting the React bar.

JSX is not just for HTML, React Native generates Views (like Flutter Widgets) from the XML markup.

There are certainly ways to empirically study code readability, and we can have a more serious discussion when it's time for Q4 planning. To make such a study useful, we need to define what kinds of reading tasks are important to developers in the context of Flutter programming. In addition to reading a whole build method and picture what the resulting UI might be, readability also affects smaller tasks such as identifying the build method in a dart file, matching braces, reading inline comments, etc. 

To support some of those more narrowly-scoped tasks, we can experiment with UI enhancements in the editor first, which is usually cheaper than introducing and maintaining a markup language. The closing label feature in VS code is one of such UI enhancements, and we should understand how well it solves the brace matching problem it sets out to address. There are plenty of other options in this space we haven't tried yet. For example, a different font or background color might be used to display the build method to help the developer mentally separate it from the rest of their code.

Another thing that strikes me as important is how we can encourage people to not write giant build method and take advantage of the composition nature of the framework. If the build method is taller than the height of your screen, it's going to be hard to read regardless it's Dart or XML.  +++$+++ 1 +++$+++ 0

It's not just the build method. It's all other methods that the build method calls to build the widget tree. Very common in React to use smaller methods to build sub-tree pieces and then call those into the larger tree. 

Also in WebStorm with JSX, each XML node has +/- that can be used to expand/collapse node and children to make reading structures larger than the height of the screen easier.

Does it really become a reusable widget or simply a wrapper/composite widget? I mean to be reusable you should have at least 2 usage instances. 

The AppBar on https://flutter.io/catalog/samples/basic-app-bar/ is so unique that you can't really call it an reusable component; it's a wrapper/composite component and in these cases why not just use a local method to build that part of the UI? I guess if it did more things it would make sense to place it in a wrapper/composite component.

> One thing we've found in Flutter is that big build methods are not great for performance

Since you mentioned performance, having the animation loop drive the build method will cause performance problems for smooth animation. You don't want your build method called 60 times a second or more, specially considering that the build method is user code (for example, it could have a super long loop that takes forever and it would cause animations to skip). Being a Flutter beginner perhaps I got that wrong.
