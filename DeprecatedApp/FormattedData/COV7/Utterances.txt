This commit adds Yarn to the Node release tarballs and installers. I tested:

- Windows (`.\vcbuild.bat msi` and ran the resulting exe)
- MacOS (`make pkg` and ran the resulting pkg)
- Linux (untar'd the `.tar.gz` file)

In all cases, running `yarn --version` yielded the correct Yarn version (1.22.5 for infra reasons, which is for all purposes identical to 1.22.10 minus a postinstall script which has no impact whatsoever in this situation).

You assert that you expect people to stop using Yarn in favor of Berry, and have data to back that up. Further, you assert that the only changes you're planning on making are security changes - this is relatively well demonstrated by the [backlog of PRs](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/pulls) that are submitted solving issues that users are having but aren't being merged or addressed, including tiny ones like [fixing broken links](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/pull/8427).

From the perspective of looking at Node.js over the next few years - rather than the short-term benefit of such a change - I frankly cannot see a reason why the Node.js project would take something on that's actively and intentionally being migrated off of as a result of the maintainers' choice in direction for it and isn't addressing problems end-users are facing outside of security issues. +++$+++ 27 +++$+++ 1

That's because you're deriving an incorrect premise, which is that Yarn 1 doesn't address problems end-users are facing. To reiterate:

**Yarn 1 isn't legacy**

Yarn 1, as it is, is fine. It has its flaws, and some people would like more features, but, and that's critical, **its value comes from its stability**. People using Yarn 1.x right now have a project that already works. They may hit edge cases every once in a while, but the whole reason they use it is that they mostly figured out that the tradeoff was still value-positive for their current project. **Being frozen is a feature**, it's a gift that we are giving. It means that existing users won't get accidental regressions or bugs. **Yarn is about stability, and putting our users in control.** You shouldn't need to upgrade just because we release something new.

Yarn 2 is technologically better in many aspects. It would be easier for us to simply say that it should be the global binary at all time and that's it - similar to how npm is distributed. But different projects value different things, and in our case we care a lot about giving each user exactly the version they expect - whether it's Yarn 1, 2, 3, or 42. We care about it so much that we introduced a builtin feature for that three years ago, that we made it the default a year ago, and that we started the discussions around Corepack three months ago.

Of course it means that not all users are necessarily on the latest release. That's fine! Because they already have a tool that solves their needs right now, and because we'll never break semantics by redefining existing fields or ranges - as that would negatively affect past users by forcing them to upgrade. Now, perhaps later their use case will evolve, they'll need better perfs, or to solve a particular bug, or to implement something on their own, and they'll upgrade to the latest release, which will keep receiving regular bugfixes and new features. But perhaps not, and that's fine, because they will still follow an explicitly supported use case. +++$+++ 5 +++$+++ 4

At no point am I basing my assertion in that on the premise that Yarn 1 doesn't address problems end-users are facing. Bower is a good tool that solve(d/s) problems that end-users were facing. There are absolutely still people using it in production, and it still "works" as far as I'm aware.

That's not justification for being bundled in Node.js, imo.

I can understand where you're coming from here, but this sounds like a pitch to me. It feels like justification of decisions without crediting the potential trade-offs or drawbacks of those decisions.

There's so much to deconstruct in this bit so rather than doing it in paragraphs, I'm going to try to summarize in bullets:

* "It has its flaws" there are bug reports and PRs to patch them that are going unmerged. This is a very... simple and kind way to frame this.
* "People using Yarn 1.x right now have a project that already works." People using pnpm, bower, or jspm also have projects that work. If they're already using it and have a workflow that works for them, why do we need to include Yarn in Node.js? Why is yarn different from those other package managers?
* "They may hit edge cases every once in a while, but the whole reason they use it is that they mostly figured out that the tradeoff was still value-positive for their current project." Same point as above. If they're already using it and have a workflow around that, what is the reason to add it to Node.js?
* "Being frozen is a feature, it's a gift that we are giving." Framing a decision you've made as a "gift" implies that the recipient should be grateful. If they're not, that sets them up to be the villain. Frankly, I don't really think this framing has a space in this PR nor, honestly, to our users.
* "It means that existing users won't get accidental regressions or bugs. Yarn is about stability, and putting our users in control." How is this different than permanently pinning to a package manager version across a company? I can use the first-ever published version of Yarn and expect the same, just like I can for npm, pnpm, Bower, or jspm.
* "You shouldn't need to upgrade just because we release something new." Wasn't your previous assertion that you're only going to be doing security releases from now on?

I am entirely familiar with the arguments around projects being "done" and feature complete. I think that those reasons are entirely fine within userland. Where I think we need to be more critical of that is when we're committing it into Node.js in a way that is effectively irrevocable.

Again, if they already have the tool why are we putting it in Node.js core? Doing so would _force_ them to change their existing workflows - including involuntarily upgrading users who are on an older version - which seems to be antithetical to the stated goals of Yarn. +++$+++ 15 +++$+++ 0

I don't think you understand this diff, or how Yarn is distributed. All versions of Yarn act both as a package manager and a jumper (similar, if you will, to `gulp-cli`). If it finds a `yarnPath` entry in `.yarnrc.yml`, it will use it instead of the global one. In other words, older projects will use Yarn 1 (because that's the global version used as fallback when nothing is found), or the checked-in package manager if it finds the right configuration to do so. Put simply, everyone gets what they ask for. There is no "involuntarily upgrading users who are on an older version". On the other hand, it does require *a* Yarn to be globally available.

> I can understand where you're coming from here, but this sounds like a pitch to me. It feels like justification of decisions without crediting the potential trade-offs or drawbacks of those decisions.

Let's be clear - you're telling *me* that I don't credit trade-offs or drawbacks, on a project I maintain, for a protocol that was designed a year ago, and for which noone has reported any automated breakage of any system, while still being able to migrate at the time of their choice. At this point I don't know what to tell you.

Are you 100% certain, without question, that nobody is relying on the global yarn to be a specific version rather than using `yarnPath`? If there is _anyone_ who is and they upgrade, it'll very quickly become our problem.

> you're telling me that I don't credit trade-offs or drawbacks, on a project I maintain

Yes. In the paragraph you wrote - which is clearly what I was replying to - you only focus on the aspirational positives of Yarn v1 being frozen (outside of security updates, which you'd mentioned in a previous comment) without addressing potential trade-offs or drawbacks in a neutral way. I'm not sure how that's seemingly absurd or controversial to you.

> That's answered.

You point to the Binary Management Discussion, which is somewhat about Corepack but ended up being more about version management. The [PR](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/35398) you opened, says this:

No 2.x stable release was ever made on the npm registry. The last one which was, `2.0.0-rc.27` (out of 36), was only assigned to a `berry` tag. I'm positive no Yarn 2 user relies on a specific global version.

As for Yarn 1 users, past releases were semver-compliant, so 1.22.5 (the latest one) can installs the whole 1.x line. I would also point out that this wouldn't be any different from how npm releases work: you recently upgraded npm from 6 to 7, which is far riskier than Yarn 1.20 to 1.22 - at least semver-wise. +++$+++ 2 +++$+++ 0

Only remark I have: as we probably all know, which package managers people use tend to be a quite polarizing topic, where both communities can sometimes display a certain lack of empathy. Years ago it was Emacs v Vim, then Tabs v Space, and nowadays Yarn v npm. I feel the need to mention this, because studies have shown that those who oppose tend to be more vocal than those who support, especially when the opposition is the status quo.

Given that the primary goal (at least for me) is to help current users, not necessarily acquire new ones, I'd be wary of the survey wording. Specifically, I'd be cautious about not making it look like a "two parties" question. In my opinion, the survey would benefit by proving not only that a segment of the Node community would be positively impacted by this change, but also that even those who wouldn't directly benefit from it *wouldn't be negatively impacted* either.

For instance, rather than "would you like it? Y/N/neutral", which could incite non-Yarn users to answer N rather than neutral, perhaps a more suitable question would be "would it benefit your workflows? Y/N; would it impede your workflows? Y/N" (perhaps with a "Why?" box on each, to get testimonies on both sides). Basically focusing on the effects rather than the feelings. My 2 cents.

Node.js has a release calendar that makes changes planable.

I would also add that the ecosystem needs to be able to add features to package management systems. Blessing a package manager that can't receive feature updates would reduce the ability for the Node community to adapt to changes.

Which is a very interesting example, thanks for bringing that up. The RFC you're talking about has received strong objections from both Yarn and pnpm - objections which from what transpire from the issue don't plan to be addressed. In other words, npm being the only package manager is already putting the ecosystem at risk (at least under their current handling of RFCs).

Also note that this isn't a unique occurence - in fact, it already happened a few months ago with npm 7, which tried to change how peer dependencies are semantically defined. Just like now, the RFC received early and strong pushback from both Yarn and pnpm (and other projects), but the RFC author decided to ignore them and go with it.

The lack of package managers diversity (and thus neutrality) is a problem. The role of the Node TSC is to find a solution. This PR (along with others) is a way to do that. If you have a better one go for it? I don't mind seeing competing ideas. +++$+++ 3 +++$+++ 0

That depends entirely on the point of view and on how accountable that authority is to the community. Even with the RFC process, npm's roadmap is still controlled by a singular commercial interest. Perhaps the better forum for such discussions would be the OpenJS Foundation, where a spec and reference implementation for such things could live while allowing competition on specific implementations. But... that's a separate conversation.

@iarna does raise a valid point about ensuring that bugs that need to be fixed in the 1.x stream are fixed in 1.x. As I understand it, there's no intent on shipping yarn2 in core which means we cannot interpret "fixed in 2" as being meaningful here. @arcanis addresses that concern rather well [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node/discussions/37193#discussioncomment-341216). So long as there is a demonstrated commitment to ensuring that security and critical bug fixes are made, and that yarn1 remains functional/compatible with Node.js@latest, then I'm not sure what else can be said there that would be convincing. Specifically, no one has asserted that the yarn versions shipped in node.js would be "unupdatable".

I would not expect Node.js to just accept that unquestioningly. I would expect Node.js to hold Yarn accountable to that promise that the issues would be addressed, and if it turns out the issues are not addressed and major bugs persist, then we would always have the option of removing yarn from the distribution.

@iarna also said:
> ...if that lands in a way that's acceptable and adopted the major package managers still under development, it would be very uncomfortable for Node itself to be shipping with one that didn't support it.

But that's not the case here. Node.js would not just be shipping a single package manager option that did not support the feature, it would continue shipping multiple package manager options. It would be up to users to determine what they want to use -- and whether support for that new feature is important to them or not. The users would give us the necessary feedback to determine which is the right path. That said, it would be rather unfriendly to the ecosystem as a whole for a single package manager run by a singular commercial interest to unilaterally ship a new feature that would qualify as a "must support" by others. +++$+++ 3 +++$+++ 0

>Which is a very interesting example, thanks for bringing that up. The RFC you're talking about has received strong objections from both Yarn and pnpm - objections which from what transpire from the issue don't plan to be addressed. In other words, npm being the only package manager is already putting the ecosystem at risk (at least under their current handling of RFCs).

Which is exactly why I included this caveat:

> if that lands in a way that's acceptable and adopted the major package managers 

There were suggestions in that RFC that you expressed support for. I don't believe consensus is impossible.

**Are you suggesting that the Node Foundation will be taking on responsibility for updating Yarn1 in the future, if it's included? If that were the case then my concerns would be answered.** Right now the problem is, if you have to patch Yarn1 you're SOL. You have to support floating patches forever and the version users can install independently diverges from the one bundled with Node.

Surely that is true, and also not afaict relevant? +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

No, I'm saying that we would look to yarn to fix those issues and if they do not we retain the option of removing it from the distribution. It's no different than the relationship with npm today. Fixes are made upstream.  +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

But, and maybe I'm misunderstanding(?), they are as a matter of  policy not making fixes. It's frozen to the degree that you can't fix bugs in it. There is no plan to have more releases of Yarn 1, is there?

Edited to add: If Yarn 1 were actively maintained, receiving bug fixes, I would have no complaints. But "frozen but not legacy" isn't enough, imo. All I want is _someone_ to be responsible for it. +++$+++ 6 +++$+++ 0
