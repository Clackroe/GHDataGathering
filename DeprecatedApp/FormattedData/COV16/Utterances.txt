I'm trying to run this new Windows Terminal.

After some difficulties and a few attempts I was able to build and deploy the project locally.  
*«Great! Finally!»* I said to myself, just before clicking on the `Windows Terminal (Dev Build)` in the Start menu...

This was the result: an empty window.

After a few seconds, it simply disappeared and then...  
Well... Nothing more!

Here are some useful (hopefully) information about my current system:

Some time ago, I commented already here (https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/489#issuecomment-502067642) explaining the same issue...

Sadly my x86 tablet doesn't have enough storage to be able to install VS onto it and VS won't let me set up a remote debugging profile for x86 (says Debug|x86 is missing from the project manifest when I even attempt to open the properties) so at the moment, my attempts to get to the bottom of why have stalled...

I may need to set up a x86 VM just to debug with :/ assuming the behavior persists there as well.

Today I was using my notebook on my legs (without any devices connected).  
Usually, I use my notebook connected to this [Universal Dock](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-universal-dock-d6000/apd/452-bcyt/pc-accessories).

These kind of devices ([DisplayLink](https://www.displaylink.com/) docks) are seen by the OS as external video cards without extended support for hardware acceleration...  
In facts, you can't run video games or 3D graphics in general even if your GPU is the best one you can buy!

---

So, I think, if the video card you're trying to render the Terminal on isn't compatible with hardware acceleration (or something like that) it, simply, crashes badly.

It could be also your case @ShadowEO, @magiblot and @tanayagar?  
Maybe something like:

- Cheap hardware?
- Integrated video cards?
- Virtual machines?

Yes, I do have an Intel GPU (HD Graphics 520) but drivers and harware acceleration are in order. I don't use a docking station or VM, altough I do have this laptop connected to an external display through VGA/DP. But unplugging it changed nothing. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

Yes, I am on cheap hardware for this device, it's a TMAX TM101W635L. Using an Intel HD Graphics (I am unsure of the exact model atm, as I am away from the machine.)

Virtual Machines work fine on the device, but they aren't in active use (on 2 GBs of non-expandable RAM, you can see why).

My tests are all done on device itself, so no docking stations, no external hardware at all.

I also tried on another computer equipped with an NVidia GTX 970 and it worked well.

I did some other tests and, for some reason, when I run the Terminal on the external monitor connected through the docking station in crashes (as I said before)...  
But, if I run it on the internal monitor (works fine, of course) and then I drag the window onto the external monitor, it continues to run without any problems. 😵

I suspect that the issues related to not being able to use hardware rendering might be solved with #1263.

There's probably also some robustness to be added to the DX renderer so it sets itself up correctly. If any of you are building from source, it would be nice to have you check if conhost.exe built from the same sources crashes when the key at `HKCU\Console` `UseDx` `REG_DWORD` `0x1` is set (create it if it isn't there.) That will confirm if a crash is isolated to the DX renderer or Terminal startup specific.

I also have the theory that you are all experiencing like 4 different issues here, so we might have to split them up if I try to fix one and it isn't fixed for all of you.

Lastly, we don't readily have access to this type of hardware around here. I'll see what we can do, but if I can get some close assistance, that's the best.

I also went to my development station (x64) and attempted the `UseDx` change you requested. I can confirm that conhost fails to start with `UseDx` set to `0x1` on a machine where the same source build does work properly. Toggling `UseDx` back off results in a working console again.

You can technically right click a process in the Details page of Task Manager and create a dump and attach it somewhere online, but be warned, it may contain personally identifiable information as it dumps the entire memory space.

You can also try using the Feedback Hub and choosing the Windows Terminal app and submitting that way.

Or if it crashes, you can try getting the Windows Error Reporting information from the event viewer and give me all of that so I can try to look up the IDs with the WER service. +++$+++ 1 +++$+++ 0
