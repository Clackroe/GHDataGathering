An easy fix would be to replace our use of whitelist with allowlist and blacklist with denylist.

We can even just use them as verbs directly, as we do with the former terms. So something is allowlisted or denylisted.

I took a quick look and it seems like this change is mostly about docs. We only have one piece of the code that I could find on a search that uses the term whitelist with `enforce_raw_sql_whitelist`. Need to consider whether we need an alias and a deprecation for that. +++$+++ 61 +++$+++ 21
COM0 +++$+++ SP14361073 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ 2018-08-22T00:57:07Z +++$+++ Good intentions, but I doubt there's any relation of the origin of the terms blacklist/whitelist to race. There are many idioms and phrases in the English language that make use of colours without any racial backstories.
I haven't met any black person (myself included) who was ever offended by the use of "blacklist". Frankly, a good number find it patronising to make this kind of change. +++$+++ 39 +++$+++ 0

COM7 +++$+++ SP526479 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM6 +++$+++ 2018-08-22T03:07:33Z +++$+++ I think this is a great idea, I have proposed internally at multiple companies I've worked at changing master/slave and blacklist/whitelist to leader/replica and allowlist/denylist, if only because in an industry with poor representation it feels incredibly overt to be standing in a room full of mostly white people using these terms outloud.

It doesn't matter what the origin or intent of this was, or whether people can find a narrow lens through which to see it as not a problem.  Consider using these terms in a coding or systems interview with someone you have just met.

I understand that some black people may not consider these terms offensive, but I would rather someone not want to work with me because they think I am too politically correct than because they think I am too insensitive and blind.

That said and since I think this issue will garner overwhelming support in this community, I do support a compromise suggested by @rafaelfranca's review to replace the actual words with their definition or some other phrase that is more fluid than a single term. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
