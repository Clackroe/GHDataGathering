**File size**
I'm not sure where you're getting these numbers, this is what I see:

```
Lara.sea: 1,032,525 bytes 
Lara.glb: 1,850,164 bytes

Lara.sea.gz: 1,031,840 bytes
Lara.glb.gz: 919,712 bytes 
```

**Materials**
Your model uses `Diffuse + Specular`. Unfortunately, seems like the specular texture is not being exported. GLTF supports 2 PBR modes: `Metalness + Roughness` and `Specular + Glossiness`. You want to export your model using the second mode. `GLTFLoader` supports both but maybe the Babylon.js doesn't have an option to export in that mode? In that case you may want to do a feature request on their project.

1. File size.
If you download the files (with Firefox) you'll get:
Lara.sea: 658,901 bytes
Lara.glb: 1,850,964 bytes
Even more: the GLB file does not even contain the equivalent (Metalness) of the Specular texture !

2) Materials
As I said before, the original MAX  and FBX files contain a standard PHONG material:
Diffuse + Specular + Normal 
None of the current GLTF exporters and converters is able to generate a correct Physical material.
PHONG is way more popular than Physical.

p.s.
I'm not interested in the GLTF format (SEA3D is better from any point of view).

Here is a NATIVE Physical material in 3DS Max 2018 exported to GLTF with Babylon3D exporter:
http://necromanthus.com/Test/html5/Lara_gltf_physical.html 
Now the metalness is present, but the result is still wrong:
- it looks emissive (but it's not)
- it has a red color bump

However, this GLB file looks better (compared to THREE) in the Babylon sandbox ( https://sandbox.babylonjs.com ).
Again, this is how the Physical material should look in THREE:
http://necromanthus.com/Test/html5/Lara_PBR.html 

So let's forget now about PHONG and buggy exporters and converters.
We should investigate why the GLB file looks better in the Babylon sandbox.

Something better (no wasted resources):
```javascript

```

> The last thing to do is setting renderer.gammaOutput = true. (Needed when using GLTF #12766)

That indicates buggy GLTF Loader (and it has to be fixed).
If I use that for other loaders, I get wrong colors for the loaded models.
Just think about this scenario: use various loaders for the same scene and one of them is GLTF.
It will mess up the entire scene!

Anyway, after removing that ambient light and using this workaround, this is the result:
http://necromanthus.com/Test/html5/Lara_gltf_physical.html 
Much better compared to the initial GLTF one, but the material quality is far away from this one:
http://necromanthus.com/Test/html5/Lara_PBR.html 
Impressive lighting response and great metalness for bra and bikini.

At this stage I won't use GLTF in any serious project.

This is a deliberate decision and not a bug. Base color and emissive textures in glTF (and, typically, diffuse textures in any format...) are in sRGB colorspace. GLTFLoader marks them as such (`material.map.encoding = THREE.sRGBEncoding`), so that they're converted to linear colorspace for correct PBR lighting calculations. Finally colors should be converted back to sRGB (e.g. `renderer.gammaOutput=true`).

If you skip all of this, with any format, lighting calculations are incorrect. SEA3DLoader, FBXLoader, and ColladaLoader never touch the `.encoding` property of any texture, and leave it to the end user to change texture colorspace and renderer colorspace. I'm pretty confident that the large majority of three.js users are passing sRGB colors into three.js without converting, despite the fact that renderer lighting calculations assume linear colorspace, and getting results that are "good enough" but inconsistent with other engines and authoring environments. For correct results you should be using `renderer.gammaOutput=true`, and marking sRGB textures as sRGB.

None of these issue are specific to glTF (see https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/11337), but with GLTFLoader we're trying to achieve consistency with other engines and 3D authoring environments, and have chosen to treat all sRGB textures as sRGB for a first step. If you're mixing models from other formats in the scene, then yes it's awkward, and you'd need to either mark the diffuse textures of those formats as sRGB or mark the colorspace on the glTF models to linear (the latter is incorrect for all model formats involved, but may look good enough if you don't need precise colors).

Ricardo,
PHONG looks great with Diffuse + Specular only.
PBR does not look great with BaseColor + MetallicRoughness only.
That's the main problem here.
The Normal/Bump and Environment textures are irrelevant at this point.
On top of that: more texture layers = bigger file size and performances drop

I'm not debating the "PBR only" bad choice for GLTF.
This topic shows GLTFLoader design flaws.
We don't reinvent the wheel here, so "renderer.gammaOutput = true" is not an option now, when GLTF represents less than 1% of the market.

Being able to author a PBR model in Substance Painter or download one from Sketchfab, and have the model appear as the artist designed it, is good for three.js users. I don't think there's any definition of "best result" where that sort of consistency can be dismissed.

> This topic shows GLTFLoader design flaws. We don't reinvent the wheel here, so "renderer.gammaOutput = true" is not an option now...

This isn't reinventing any wheels, and it isn't a design flaw. PBR calculations are done in linear space, with every engine I'm aware of. If you pass sRGB data into the renderer and pretend it's linear, the lighting and blending math will come out wrong. The difference is not huge, and so this not a major concern for many three.js users, but nevertheless it is not as good as it could be. For that reason, your "good" result example is not actually correct. But as you've said before, backward-compatibility is important, so I'm not here to advocate for changing any three.js defaults. But because glTF is a new format, and because we're trying to get PBR right, we're going to mark sRGB textures as sRGB, even if other loaders are not doing so.

See [this article about Unreal](http://artbyplunkett.com/Unreal/unrealgamma.html) â€” 

> ...textures that are used for color information should have the sRGB flag checked, and textures that are used for masks and numerical calculations in shaders and effects (like Normal maps) should have it unchecked. And if you follow this simple guideline you mostly get the best effect.

> ...should other loaders be doing so? It seems like this inconsistency between loaders is a point of confusion for users, and it would make sense for all of them to treat sRGB textures the same way if possible.

If we had a time machine, yes, the other loaders should also be marking sRGB textures containing color data as sRGB. But making the change now would cause confusion and break backward-compatibility, and the `gammaOutput=true` setting needed to fix output is not intuitive â€” I don't think changing other loaders can be justified given those issues.

Let's keep an eye on https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/11337. I hope the resolution there will make color workflows more intuitive. With that and NodeMaterial, there may be opportunities to fix some existing issues without breaking anyone's existing applications. +++$+++ 2 +++$+++ 1

Yeah, it's unfortunate but I agree that it's not worth breaking backwards compatibility over this. 

However, as I've been working with larger FBX scenes consisting of multiple models, animated cameras and so on I've found myself wishing that the output of the loader was something more like GLTFLoader's output - that is, it should return an `fbx` object with properties:

```
fbx.animations; // Array<THREE.AnimationClip>
fbx.models; // Array <THREE.Group, THREE.Mesh, THREE.SkinnedMesh>
fbx.cameras; // Array<THREE.Camera>
fbx.asset; // Object
```

There may be other loaders that would benefit from a similar change.  We should add this to the backburner (and certainly wait on #11337), but if any loaders do have breaking changes made for whatever reason, then we can use that as opportunity to apply this change as well.
