Challenge ES6 - Write Higher Order Arrow Functions 
The examples show moving from normal `function` to the ES6 arrow function.  However, the challenge is about "chaining" multiple functions together.  It is super unclear how the example code would lead one to chaining a filter and map function together.  This is really a better discussion for the functional programming section.

Additionally, the filter function requires that users understand how to determine if a number is an integer or not.  There is nothing in the prior curriculum which would make it clear to a new coder how to do this.  While you do talk about the "parseInt" function, it's never used in the context of comparing a number to itself.  A better filter function might be "positive numbers" instead, which is a much simpler comparison.

I was attempting to help someone understand this one today and I was initially flummoxed as to how to solve it.

Once I realized it was about chaining, I was able to write a solution like this:
```js
const squaredIntegers = arr
    .filter(elem => elem == parseInt(elem))
    .map(elem => elem * elem);
```

I don't believe that there is another way to solve this using higher order functions and arrow functions.  There is no solution in the seed file, so I'm not sure exactly what the authors had in mind.

In short, this challenge badly needs clarification and simplification.  It may be entirely inappropriate for this section of challenges.  I could see it after a new challenge called "How to Chain Higher Order functions" or something like that.

Yup.. you are right at the moment we do not have anyone to actively oversee the curriculum's quality. We would love some help though. Its been a little while since the new curriculum was first brought in (I mean added to the beta) by the contributors, so yeah it could use the polishing up.

I know of a lot of contributors who have done some great work like @ahmadabdolsaheb @mstellaluna and @scissorsneedfoodtoo recently, just to name a few off the top of my head.

The other thing is that us shipping the platform (splitting up the curriculum infra and the user backend) has broken the contributing pipeline. The new challenge infra is supper snappy and powerful BTW. So some real potential there, that we did not have previously. No more monkey patching `console.log` !!

The challenge and user schema has changed, the tooling has changed (for good though, which we will see in a few days hopefully, when we fix things for the local setup).

We are working toward improving to the DX for contributors, as soon as we have the production really stable for us to focus on the contributions. There has been a great surge in people wanting to contribute. We are just a little swamped the moment with the support and user priority issues. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

```
Use arrow function syntax to compute the square of only the positive integers (fractions are not integers) in the array realNumberArray and store the new array in the variable squaredIntegers.
```
From those instructions it seems like the challenge wants you to use just `.filter` to accomplish this - challenges are supposed to teach a single thing, this one introduces too much and feels way too complicated - and it isn't clear to me what we are even supposed to be learning on this one +++$+++ 8 +++$+++ 0
COM5 +++$+++ SP553494 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM4 +++$+++ 2018-06-07T20:03:20Z +++$+++ I just reviewed the curriculum leading up to this challenge.
1. There doesn't appear to be an introduction to the concept of a callback function or functions as first class object.
2. No introduction to anonymous functions (except two challenges prior)
3. No mention of either map or filter

All told, I think this challenge should just be removed or moved to the functional programming section. +++$+++ 12 +++$+++ 0

I was super confused trying to solve this as well and I've even been exposed to .map() and higher order functions previously. I thought for sure there would be a way to solve it with only .filter() because they haven't even said what the other functions do when you get to this exercise, or that it's possible to chain them together. I managed to solve it with a really ugly workaround, still using .map() but forgot about .parseInt() and that you can chain the functions...

```
const filteredIntegers = arr.filter(n => n > 0 && n%2 == 1|| n%2 == 0); 
const squaredIntegers = filteredIntegers.map(x => Math.pow(x,2));
```

COM10 +++$+++ SP39616456 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM9 +++$+++ 2018-09-10T08:00:22Z +++$+++ Hi! I'm a new coder who just got to this point in the challenges. It definitely took some serious google searching to figure out a solution, since .map(), .filter(), and .reduce() had not been previously mentioned. I also only really grasped that I could chain and nest functions like:

`const squaredIntegers = arr.filter((num) => num > 0 && num == Math.floor(num)).map((num) => num * num);`

due to having learned some through Grasshopper before I started with FCC. I think some challenge on that concept before this one would've been useful, as well as challenges on filter, map, and reduce.

I know the chaining isn't necessarily required... but at this point in the challenges where the theme seems to be on condensing code, IMO it's the perfect time to bring it up.

Or in the meantime, maybe we could just point the text for the map, filter, and reduce to their relevant challenges later on, or to relevant tutorials elsewhere on the internet if FCC doesn't currently have challenges for those concepts? +++$+++ 6 +++$+++ 0

This one was a little fun to figure it out... Here are the steps I took to get the answer. I know it's a slower approach but I had to make sure that I could isolate each step before getting to the next one. I hope this helps! 
`<ol>
<li>Bring all the code into a dev console. I use chrome (I always do this first).</li>
<li>Change all the 'const' into 'var'. The reason for this is to keep copying and pasting the code to test it otherwise you will need to open a new tab to run it</li>
<li>*Keep in mind that realNumberArray is what is being filtered!</li>
<li>Only test that one value passes. Eg. - Test to make sure that the 4 goes through</li>
<li>Once known that a value can be passed parseInt(arr) can be used</li>

It's not even important that the output of the function be checked, just the syntax.  Just make sure that the instructions line up and that the tests check for the correct syntax.

2. Where is the code for the tests? The YAML has this:
`testString: getUserInput => assert(getUserInput('index').match(/const\s+squaredIntegers/g), '<code>squaredIntegers</code> should be a constant variable (by using <code>const</code>).');`
Is this the actual test? What runs this? It's hard to read. What is the best way to work on functions inside a file like this?

I was going to re-write the problem a bit to check for syntax and change the tests. Not really sure how these tests within a markdown file work. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

Seeing local changes is a bit of a process. First you need to reseed the db with `npm run seed`, then enter `npm run bootstrap`. When the last command is finished, enter `npm run develop`, then refresh the page when that's ready. You should be able to see your changes after that.

As for number 2, yes, that's the test. Tests come in pairs with a string for text and another for the testString. Text is what the user will see on the left side of the page before tests are run. The test string itself is made up of two parts--the first is the actual test, then the string after the comma which is shown in the console if the test fails.

As for the actual test suite, I believe we're using Chai. There's a cheat sheet that might help you write your tests here: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/da0df12ab7b3bae46c2a376da246a6c499afd88b/guide/english/miscellaneous/chaijs-cheatsheet/index.md

There are a number of ways you could work with functions here. How were you thinking of rewriting the challenge? A lot of the times the tests look at the return value of the function. The third test currently does this: 

```
- text: <code>squaredIntegers</code> should be <code>[16, 1764, 36]</code>
    testString: assert.deepStrictEqual(squaredIntegers, [16, 1764, 36], '<code>squaredIntegers</code> should be <code>[16, 1764, 36]</code>');

I need to run `npm run bootstrap` to see them. Is there a way around this?

 I'm familiar with Chai but will have to play around with the tests to fully get what is going on.

As for what I was going to re-write, just going to focus more on the syntax and remove the need for the function to be written in a particular way, i.e. it has to have an array named a certain way inside of it. This kind of change is what @SaintPeter suggested I do above. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

Yes I UNDERSTAND most of this yet for the life of me I cannot understand why we truncate the decimal numbers or also current value % 1 === 0 so I have been looking at this problem for 1 hour at least... I do have strong math skills and understanding yet really modulus is just remainder yet what 1===0 so does this represent NAN I seem to be confused by word definitions relative to programming. I try to run the numbers through the function in my head yet this throws me off how am I filtering the decimal numbers....
