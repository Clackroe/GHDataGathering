If you talking about that you can see only one person (Bram) in https://github.com/vim/vim/graphs/contributors, check each commit. Each contributor name is written in each commit log.
There are several hundreds of contributors in Vim.

Yes, people may enjoy it, but for me, I contribute because I want to make Vim better and not to have a nice contribution graph. Also I think it is more important that the main developer of Vim can concentrate on enhancing and improving Vim instead of having to change a workflow, that has been proven to be working well for the past 30 years.

would not doubt that;
just some people thought they joined to discuss or gave patch/advice was a help too.. i think..
especially sometime were treated as 'asking', (though some was), but some actually were 'giving' report/improvement to vim..

as for 'workflow', to do some adjust to fit some perhaps was necessary too
e.g . recording the 'commiter' name as some formal/fixed format even in the commits msg, then some stupid shell script can generate it or list it to somewhere, then everyone happy!
e.g . some runtime files owners perhaps disappeared long time / some classic plugins were not update-2-date long time, then setup a heartbeat check to confirm their alive (sorry but that's) or willing, perhaps was necessary too..

No, I don't understand.

Any software developer doing things exactly the same as 10 years ago is a **bad** software developer, let alone 30 years ago.

It literally takes less than 30 minutes to learn git. That's no excuse.

30 minutes for one person so that thousands others don't have to run through loops is a no-brainer. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 2

That's just plain not true.  A idea that was good 10 or even 30
years ago may be just as good today.  Ideas are good or bad because
they're good or bad, not because they're new or old.  To think that
a new idea is better than an old one simply because it is new is
foolish.

That's not true, either.  While basic git operations are reasonably
straightforward, anything beyond the basics is horribly obscure and
inconsistent.  To paraphrase Jamie Zawinski's comment about regular
expressions:

    Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know,
    I'll use git."  Now they have two problems.

And of course:  https://xkcd.com/1597/
