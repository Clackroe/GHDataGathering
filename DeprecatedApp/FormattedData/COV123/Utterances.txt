COM2 +++$+++ SP16597878 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM1 +++$+++ 2018-10-24T07:44:38Z +++$+++ We are really sorry to hear this. We sincerely hope you will continue to use Gatling. As we explained to you earlier, our team spends time on both projects: our open-source solution and our Enterprise solution, Gatling FrontLine.
The way we decided to split our R&D is as follows: Everything related to Gatling itself, like new support protocols, will be open-sourced (eg. HTTP/2, closed workload model and new feeders features in our latest release); On the other hand, everything related to reporting and automation features is in the scope of Gatling FrontLine. Please note that our Enterprise version helps develop both projects and have a team of 7 full-time employees. We hope you understand.
Anyway, we would gladly continue this talk with you, feel free to contact us directly. We will now close this thread.
