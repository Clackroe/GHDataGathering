ROOT +++$+++ SP2480569 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ 2020-05-19T19:10:14Z +++$+++ [Bug] Name clash with Maui Linux and MauiKit ### Description

A multi-platform app UI toolkit with the name of __maui__ was introduced by Microsoft on May 19th, 2020 according to https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-multi-platform-app-ui/:

> **MAUI** simplifies the choices for .NET developers, providing a single stack that supports all modern workloads: Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows. The native features of each platform and UI control are within reach in a simple, cross-platform API for you to deliver no-compromise user experiences while sharing even more code than before.

There has been https://mauilinux.org/ for a long time:

> Fast and easy to use, yet powerful for computer users of all levels, **Maui** is a part-rolling distribution based on KDE Neon/Ubuntu. Maui features its own managed repositories and backport channels and ships with the following software components and applications for day-to-day use

According to [Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui_Linux), Maui Linux has been around sine 2016.

Also, there has been [**Maui**Kit](https://mauikit.org/) for a long time:

> **MauiKit**, a free and modular front-end framework for developing fast and compelling user experiences

There is clearly a name clash.

### Steps to Reproduce

1.  Visit https://mauilinux.org/ and https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui_Linux
2. Visit https://mauikit.org//
3. Visit https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-multi-platform-app-ui/

### Expected Behavior

Microsoft chooses names not already used in the Linux community.

### Actual Behavior

Microsoft chooses names already used in the Linux community.

The project is called Maui, has been called that for a long time, and is even stylized as "MAUI" on https://mauikit.org. So yeah, there's an obvious naming clash here. +++$+++ 26 +++$+++ 0

We are talking about a multi platform framework called MAUI, and a multi platform framework called MAUI. You could've at least googled the name you were giving to your product before doing so, or choose one that's used from a product with a different scope.

Somehow all other cross-platform frameworks I can think of have managed to choose a name that would not conflict with other similar projects. I wonder what's so different here that would prevent Microsoft from finding a scope-unique name. +++$+++ 9 +++$+++ 0

Because it's a recent project. It has been under development for two years, but it's public. It was - until today - literally the first result when searching for "maui framework".

@dansiegel great strategy, being offending once you run out of arguments! Really! Is that how Microsoft's unpaid marketers aka "Microsoft MVP" are chosen? How can you seriously accuse others of like, thinking in this old "it's a big evil company" way (which nobody really has), while yourself being extremely off-putting towards the open-source community?

Remember, Microsoft recently admitted [they've been on the wrong side of history with regard to open source](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/05/15/microsoft_brad_smith_open_source/).

So a project has value based on open issues?

I have nothing against Microsoft, here we talk about a name and who chose it before (in the same context). 

I don't know how you can question the seriousness of one of the biggest communities that drive open source principles many years before Microsoft fell in love with open source.

There appear to be more passive-aggressive comments towards another project in this thread from you alone than there are from all other people towards this .NET repository. That's not because others really love .NET, but because they try to stay constructive here.
