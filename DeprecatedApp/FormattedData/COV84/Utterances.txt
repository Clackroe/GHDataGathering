@baslr Absolutely, why would you even think otherwise?

In this case, I am the one doing the construction work and I happen to be a man... I think. 🤔  +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

I guess the same reason why GitHub defaults to 'main' master branch name now. Good old PC BS. Apparently word 'master' has a bad stigma attached to it now 🤦‍♂️ +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

As a team, we've decided to go ahead with this rename, because reasons. This issue isn't the place to discuss the merits and drawbacks of the rename. If you feel like venting, I recommend you do so through your own personal mechanisms. Mine is running 10k out in the cold. 🏃  +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
