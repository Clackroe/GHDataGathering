I'm very new to ansible.

I'm currently running Ansible from Azure Cloud Shell.

I have added a machine to the Hosts file. However, whenever I attempt to ping or connect to the machine I get the following errors:

[WARNING]: Unable to parse /etc/ansible/hosts as an inventory source

 [WARNING]: No inventory was parsed, only implicit localhost is available

 [WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'

Can someone let me know how to fix this problem please.

Thanks

I'm not sure what you mean by 'Component Name'

Just so you know, I'm open thread on stackoverflow, which I thought might fix the issue see

However, this was just a work around to fix the underlying issue as described in this thread.

Thanks again, I hope you can help me fix this.

Hi!

Thanks very much for your interest in Ansible.  It sincerely means a lot to us. 

This appears to be a user question, and we'd like to direct these kinds of things to either the mailing list or the IRC channel.

   * IRC: #ansible on irc.freenode.net   
   * mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project

If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it.  This allows us to keep the issue tracker for bugs, pull requests, RFEs and the like.

Thank you once again and we look forward to seeing you on the list or IRC.  Thanks! +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 1

COM6 +++$+++ SP5067463 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM5 +++$+++ 2018-06-21T19:29:27Z +++$+++ @bcoca, while I fully understand your reasoning, this is detrimental to people learning how to use Ansible. Google groups are literally terrible. For example, there are 0 results for "Unable to parse /etc/ansible/hosts as an inventory source" when searching this in the group. However, Google finds multiple hits, and among the top ranking hits are these issue threads. Github issue tracker has a far superior interface because it's easy for winning solutions to be marked with reaction emojis. When a winning solution is found, the more people that it works for, the more emojis that solution will collect. This saves people a lot of time and reading, because I can skim an issue thread for the reaction emojis, I don't need to struggle to comprehend every commenter's broken english description of something that's probably not even relevant. Please reconsider. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
