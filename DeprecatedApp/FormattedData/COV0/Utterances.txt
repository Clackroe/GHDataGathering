<!-- You must include full steps to reproduce so that we can reproduce the problem. -->

1. Install and run your app on a recent iOS device using a release build.

**Expected results:** <!-- what did you want to see? -->
Flutter apps should be just as buttery as native apps, especially on the first run when it's the customer's first time opening the app getting their first impression of it.

**Actual results:** <!-- what did you see? -->
The very first start after installing is extremely janky and laggy. The next time you start it, it will be sort of fine. After a few more starts it will be smooth.

* Yes this is a release build of the app.

Here are some gifs for examples on an iPhone 8 running iOS 13.5.1.

### Very first time starting the app after a fresh install
* Notice most of the frames after the splash screen and before the screen slides up are dropped. This has the most jank (first run).
* You can really see the jank when the loader animation stops (when that screen is disposed) and the next screen starts to slide up, but it just kind of appears with no frames in between.
![first-open](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9597207/87430036-9c93bd80-c5b2-11ea-8abb-ecd8545fe0b3.gif)

### Second time opening the app
* The second time opening the app you can see the initial transition is _better_ but there is still some very noticeable jank as the screen slides up from the bottom.
![2nd-open](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9597207/87430055-a4536200-c5b2-11ea-9422-824dc1e9bdf7.gif)

### Third time opening the app
* Now the third time and every time going forward it is smooth just like you'd expect.
* But if you uninstall or update the app, then it will be janky again until the 2nd or 3rd time you open/use
![3rd-open](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9597207/87430111-b9c88c00-c5b2-11ea-8898-187186f553f5.gif)
 it.

### Screen transitions example
The same thing happens for screen transitions too.
* The first time you run a new screen transition it will be laggy.
* All future screen transitions of the same type are smooth.
* If you use a different kind of transition somewhere in your app, that one will be laggy too the first time it runs.
![screens](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9597207/87430542-59861a00-c5b3-11ea-9b42-0fa5d93bafa5.gif)

I have already tried following this doc related to SkSL caching: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Reduce-shader-compilation-jank-using-SkSL-warm-up
It fixed some of the first start jank issues on Android but has no effect on iOS (likely because of metal which is mentioned there). It also kind of is a bummer that if I want my app to be buttery smooth, I will always need to write integration tests (or do it manually) and save a dump of every transition / animation, and ensure to keep that skia shader capture file updated every time I change my app.

To be completely honest, this is not acceptable to ship the app in its current state and I am disappointed I got this far with Flutter (7+ months) before I noticed or even heard of this kind of issue. It seems to not be Flutter's fault but Skia's, but still I think new devs should know this problem exists before they get neck deep into it. It's the kind of thing you won't notice until you have a somewhat significantly-sized app and can easily overlook at first.

I really hope this can be fixed soon because it has an extremely detrimental effect on the perceived quality of your app when it's this laggy the very first time you open it, especially on brand new ios devices where native apps don't lag at all.

Before that, you can follow https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/61045#issuecomment-655658088 to compile a custom Flutter engine that turns off Metal and uses OpenGL so the SkSL warm-up would solve this issue. Flutter still used OpenGL on all iOS devices a few months ago so its performance would not be too far behind. Depending on the workload, your app may prefer trading Metal's other improvements for OpenGL's vastly faster shader warm-up performance.

Admittedly, compiling the Flutter engine takes much more time than just clicking a button, turn on a flag, or running a single command. We could have made it much easier by providing an opt-out-Metal option (https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/61045). However, we don't know if that will bring more harm than good. That's why your feedback is valuable to us, and we'd love to hear feedback from as many app developers as possible. +++$+++ 1 +++$+++ 0

Just updated to include Android.

I think the real issue here is that there is no viable fix for iOS at the moment. With android you can do the SkSL warmup routine outlined here: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Reduce-shader-compilation-jank-using-SkSL-warm-up
But this will not do anything for iOS metal devices yet (any iOS device since the iPhone 5S).

I've been trying to compile my own flutter engine with iOS metal disabled to test OpenGL but I cannot get my engine to build. If anyone can help, here is where I'm stuck now: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/61045#issuecomment-660539657 +++$+++ 3 +++$+++ 0

Yeah, I've had metal disabled for a number of weeks now. It greatly improved our app's performance with that jank gone. We've not noticed any serious performance issues that would make us want to go back.

I hope in time metal support will become better, and I hope it's easier to work around it soon. Right now flutter upgrades are quite painful as I need to recompile my engine every time I upgrade flutter versions, so I generally do it every few weeks as it takes a few hours.

@liyuqian, the opting out Metal doesn't really work since Lottie and Flare animations rendering is bad in OpenGl on iPhone X/11 ([see example here](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/61045#issuecomment-685898308)). Formally I can't submit PR against OpenGL iOS rendering, since it is not officially used. So, there is closed loop, for my application at least. We  cannot deliver to customer junky application and/or bad quality Lottie/Flare animations.
 
Please instead of changing priority to lower values, increase priority as much as possible. +++$+++ 22 +++$+++ 0
