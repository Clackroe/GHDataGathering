that typo. That’s basically stealing my public domain idea, regardless of
your CLA, and then claiming it isn’t because this wasn’t known to you.
Whacky position to be in :)

We need to say no to people who make this world unreasonable

Software wants to be Free
And you can make a stand or be a tool

One can live a life earning less than the fabled Google salary but dream of
better internet where this sort of nonsense isn’t for a bunch of lawyers to
decide

A man’s effort to further the way to build software is our birthright

It’s the direct exercise of LOGOS, the Divine Word, the ability that God
himself bestowed on man: to transform chaos into order through an act of
speech

In the beginning there was the word and the word was with God and the word
was God

Your CLA is preventing me from exercising my religious belief, a right
enshrined in your Constitution

The world is full of nonsense because nobody makes a stand

I have OCD and I really want that typo fixed, now I know it’s there, it
annoys me LOL.

Here’s another argument, your CLA is against neurodiversity.

Finally I think I have a human right to have my anguish relieved since it’s
at no cost to the company at all.

But your masters are trying to put a leash on me and to that I say, over my
dead body!
