### Description

My issue is the same as in #15949 except it is not fixed. 

I am unable to delete file (or directory). When trying, the following message appears: `Is gvfs-trash installed?`

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Try to delete any file or directory
2. ???
3. Profit

**Expected behavior:** Deleting file should delete file

**Actual behavior:** The file is not deleted

**Reproduces how often:** Every time

### Versions

```
Atom    : 1.27.1
Electron: 1.7.15
Chrome  : 58.0.3029.110
Node    : 7.9.0
```
```
apm  1.19.0
npm  3.10.10
node 6.9.5 x64
atom 1.27.1
python 2.7.15
git 2.17.1
```
```
OS: Fedora 28
```

### Additional Information
```
$ gvfs-trash
This tool has been deprecated, use 'gio trash' instead.
See 'gio help trash' for more info.
```
The `gio trash` is supposedly implemented since electron 1.7.2 and for some folks out there this problem was fixed with `Atom 1.25` (which included upgrade to `Electron 1.7.11`) but apparently I am on even newer Atom version, with even newer Electron and it still happens.

### EDIT1
#### More insight on the problem provided by @cutephoton:

### EDIT2
#### More insight, to not get confused as of the nature of the bug, and how to reproduce it (by @cutephoton as well):
> Yes, as reported, the ELECTRON_TRASH environment variable is needed. This is the issue referenced #15949 bug. The issue reported here is not related to #15949. The error message related to gvfs-trash is a blunt tool (even access denied errors produce the same error message) so I understand why people are responding here.

> The reporter clarifies one of the key symptoms here:

Yeah, that's the default error message.  Unfortunately, Electron's moveToTrash method doesn't say _why_ it failed, just that it did.  We've found that the most common reason is that `gvfs-trash` isn't installed, which is why we decided to include it in the error message. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

That's unexpected. The API documentation for [g_file_trash](https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GFile.html#g-file-trash) lacks some level of specificity.

Files located on the same partition as your home directory can always be moved to your user trash folder. On my operating system, the paths `/` and `/home` are separate partitions.

My rather verbose explanation gets in to the nitty gritty for where atom's behavior is deficient.  The short answer is that atom only asks to move files to trash and does not delete files. If a trash folder cannot be created (multiple causes all related to permissions) than it fails. Atom should inquire with user if they should permanently delete the files instead of failing.   +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

If I try to delete a file within atom, I get the following error:
![gvfs-gio-error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5628330/50742193-8be3d980-11bc-11e9-9d98-8c307d563839.png)

If I use gio on the command line:
```
$ gio trash /home/bauthier/Tools/ansible_local/roles/work_packages/files/test.txt
$
```
no issue and it deletes as expected.

My system partitions are broken up like so:
```
$ df -h
Filesystem               Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
devtmpfs                 7.8G     0  7.8G   0% /dev
tmpfs                    7.8G  225M  7.6G   3% /dev/shm
tmpfs                    7.8G  2.0M  7.8G   1% /run
tmpfs                    7.8G     0  7.8G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/mapper/fedora-root   49G   11G   36G  24% /
tmpfs                    7.8G  236K  7.8G   1% /tmp
/dev/sda2                976M  160M  750M  18% /boot
/dev/mapper/fedora-home  414G  892M  392G   1% /home
/dev/sda1               1022M   21M 1002M   3% /boot/efi
tmpfs                    1.6G  8.4M  1.6G   1% /run/user/1000
```
If I explicitly set an environment variable like this within my **~/.bashrc**:
```
export ELECTRON_TRASH=gio
```
it does delete within atom correctly.

Having to set this environment variable is less than ideal. I read through cutephoton's research, testing, and analysis and I believe mine works because **/home** and **/** are on different mounts, but the same partition. Perhaps LVM versus standard partitions?

Either way, I would imagine the handling of "gvfs" or "gio" would be done by atom and set correctly during start time of the application. I haven't read through the atom code so there may have been a reason to couple that functionality to "gvfs" rather than dynamically choosing a suitable trash program and application startup.
