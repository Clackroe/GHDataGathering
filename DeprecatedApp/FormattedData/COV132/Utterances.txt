Hey,

maybe instead of removing Santa Claus hat because 1 SJW, can you make an option to turn it on and off in options? Really, why you have to remove it? +++$+++ 62 +++$+++ 2

We must remove the hat, all mentions of the hat, all mentions of removing the mentions of the hat and so on, just to be sure. Oh no, I just mentioned way too many forbidden things, so this is getting removed too. Along with this thread. And me. And you. +++$+++ 32 +++$+++ 1

The story of Santa Claus is not directly tied to any religion in particular. While yes, it's stems from Christianity, nowadays it's completely secular.. If Santa is a religious figure, then so is the Grinch,

It's so sad that people are so sensitive in the world we live in today that this sort of thing is even worth discussion.. +++$+++ 10 +++$+++ 1
