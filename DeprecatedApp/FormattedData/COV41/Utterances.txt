COM1 +++$+++ SP1073714 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM0 +++$+++ 2018-06-08T23:39:17Z +++$+++ @terminalmage I've forgot to change the last error message, which is "invalid Python". That just misleads people and they don't understand what is going on, hence the fix. Salt SSH still needs to have both library sets (dependencies) on the Master for the specific Python versions, so the `.tar.gz` is carrying over those in `py<major version>` subdirectories.

@dincamihai NOTE: actually if you are running Salt on a Master from the specific version, you _do not_ need to install Salt again for the alternative version, as it is anyway works for both versions. This is just packaging convenience. But in fact you need only couple of version-specific libraries to be installed so they will be picked up by the `thin` creation procedure. That is, probably we should not say "install Salt for alternative Python X" (which implies you will get all the needed dependencies automatically), but "install Salt _dependencies_ only for the alternative Python X".

COM4 +++$+++ SP1615643 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM3 +++$+++ 2018-06-11T11:26:33Z +++$+++ @isbm  having 3.x there means that it matches all the 3 subversions. if I remove the .x someone might think it would only apply to 3 and this would make it more confusing.

Adding new line to the text is ignored and I'm not sure I should spend more time on this.

Your example seems to remove some of the useful information and has this "on a Master" that I don't understand. Is that intended or should it be "on the Master"?
I was using origin and target in order to avoid Master and Minion because none of these machines have salt-master or salt-minion running. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM5 +++$+++ SP1073714 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM4 +++$+++ 2018-06-11T11:37:24Z +++$+++ @dincamihai the "3.x" is the same as "3", as I see it. I also suggested to use integers as in the `version_info` instead of just strings. And so if we have some issue with the 3.8 (e.g.) one would just add a minor version key. Otherwise default should go. But "3.x" is more to me looks like a hack.

The "origin" is something that might not be understood. Personally to me it is very odd terminology here. And you are running "SaltSSH" from the Master (or want-to-be-master). +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM6 +++$+++ SP1615643 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM5 +++$+++ 2018-06-11T11:47:32Z +++$+++ @isbm i'm checking first for major.minor, so if we add 3.8 it will go to that first. only if there is not major.minor it will match major.x. i think we are fine here. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM7 +++$+++ SP1073714 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM6 +++$+++ 2018-06-11T11:57:16Z +++$+++ @dincamihai correct. So that means there **is something** that needs to be shown _instead of_ the default message. And if you have none of '8', then you will get the default one:

```python
msg = {
    2: {
        6: 'Too old',
        7: 'Soon to be dead',
        'default': 'Problem between the keyboard and the chair',
    },
    3: {
        4: 'Many things are missing in this release',
        6: 'Many things are incompatible with the previous release, ha-ha!',
        8: 'Larry Wall was hired to design new Python language syntax',
        'default': 'I like you begging, do it again',
    }
}

import sys
mj, mn = sys.version_info[:2]
print(msg[mj].get(mn, msg[mj]['default']))

COM12 +++$+++ SP1073714 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM11 +++$+++ 2018-06-11T13:39:49Z +++$+++ OK, as per speaking with @dincamihai it would be also an option to:

- Add all the options into the documentation.
- Add short minimally intrusive to the target machine option (i.e. update the SaltSSH side w/o touching the target)

That said, CLI would return something like:
```
The "my-to-be-minion.greatdomain.com" machine is running Python 2.6 version.
Please install Salt for 2.6 Python on the Salt SSH machine and set it up.
```

or:
```
The "my-to-be-minion.greatdomain.com" machine is running Python 2.7 version.
Please install Salt for 2.7 Python on the Salt SSH machine.
```

So such info on the CLI would suggest what to do now, quickly and easiest way. And the following would go to the documentation (rephrased into more extended version):

"Depending on the Python version on the target, you need to install Python2.7 compatible salt on origin to add support for Python2.7 targets or install Python2.6 compatible salt on origin to add support for Python2.6 targets or upgrade to Python==3.x on target"

sometimes, when targeting 1000 machines, maybe 999 are ok but one has an old python. there are two options and we don't know what it is better for the user:
 - update the origin machine (that works on 999 of the clients) or
 - update the one client that doesn't work

More here: https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/targeting/ So calling it "target" and "origin" brings lots of confusion from this POV.

It would not make any sense to make additional changes and test the whole thing again with python2.6, 2.7 and 3 and combinations of them just because someone likes it more is some way.
