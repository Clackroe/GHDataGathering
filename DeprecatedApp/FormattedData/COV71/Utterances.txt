start by installing bootstrap in your project -
```
npm install bootstrap@4.0.0-alpha.6 --save
```
(notice bootstrap has two dependencies - jquery and tether. If you would rather have explicit versions of those two, you should install them as well)

import bootstrap's javascript through index.js -
```javascript
import 'bootstrap';
```
(i'm assuming you're using es6, in case of es5, use `require('bootstrap')`)

The previous line will only import the js part of bootstrap. for the styling part you have two options -

### 1. Precompiled SASS
Inside one of your sass files (index.scss for example) add this line -
```SASS
@import "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss";
```
(notice the ~ (tilde) which points to the node modules folder)
This mehtod is beneficial if you plan on using your own version of the wonderful __variables_ file bootstrap comes with. just make sure you import __variables_ before _bootstrap_. Also, now you can use all the cool mixins bootstrap has.

### 2. Compiled CSS only
If you're not planning on using the variables or the mixins, and prefer the precooked css file, simply add this line to index.js or any other js file -
```javascript
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
```
(btw - you can also import this way the sass file, but it's nicer to import it via another sass file as shown in pervious mehtod)

now comes the webpack part. for _jquery_ and _tether_ to be available as a global variable throughout the project, you'll have to add this to your webpack plugins sections -
```javascript
new webpack.ProvidePlugin({ // inject ES5 modules as global vars
  $: 'jquery',
  jQuery: 'jquery',
  'window.jQuery': 'jquery',
  Tether: 'tether'
})
```
The different jquery definition are meant to answer requirements of different libraries (for example angular looks for 'window.jQuery'). I'm assuming your webpack.config already has rules for scss and/or css.

And that's it! now you have bootstrap in your webpack project.
Let me know if any further explanation is needed, and if anyone knows of a better way, please share. +++$+++ 64 +++$+++ 0

@IdanCo Do you need to install a dependency to be able to use `~` instead of the `node_modules` folder?
I tried it but it didn't work. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM1 +++$+++ SP10364499 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM0 +++$+++ 2017-03-16T14:09:34Z +++$+++ @Olivia101 good question. [I took this convention from sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader#imports), but if in addition to sass-loader you're also using postcss than this could be related -
https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import/issues/209

Anyway you can try without the tilde, or worst case use '../../node_modules'.

let me know how it goes. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

I'm also using Bootstrap w/ Webpack but I have a slightly different configuration regarding the "Jquery & Tether" part.

Instead of using this :
```javascript
new webpack.ProvidePlugin({ // inject ES5 modules as global vars
  $: 'jquery',
  jQuery: 'jquery',
  'window.jQuery': 'jquery',
  Tether: 'tether'
})
```
which does not inject $ as a global variable but 'auto-require' it when encountered in a dependency, I use the "expose-loader" (which, actually, expose global variables ;-) ).

You could use it directly in the webpack config but, personnaly, I prefer using it in my entry file like this : 
```javascript
require('expose-loader?$!expose-loader?jQuery!jquery');
require("expose-loader?Tether!tether");
```
(yeah, the syntax looks like some sort of incantations or something ;-))

But if you prefer the webpack config way, it looks like this : 
```javascript
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: require.resolve('jquery'),
      use: [
        { loader: 'expose-loader', options: 'jQuery' },
        { loader: 'expose-loader', options: '$' }
      ]
    },
    
    {
      test: require.resolve('tether'),
      use: [
        { loader: 'expose-loader', options: 'Tether' }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

1. when importing scss, you do it directly from the js or from a secondary scss file?
2. If you use a secondary scss file, do rules before/after the import **are working** in the browser?
3. what version of style-loader are you using? +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

1. use a secondary scss, and add this code **before** importing bootstrap -
```sass
$navbar-inverse-color: #FFF;
$navbar-light-color: #FFF; 
```
2. upgrade style-loader to 0.17.0

`import 'bootstrap';`

The TypeScript compiles, but I am given the following error on page load:

```
main.ts:3 Uncaught Error: Cannot find module "bootstrap"
    at webpackMissingModule (main.ts:3)
    at Object../ts/main.ts (main.ts:3)
    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:19)
    at bootstrap:68
    at bootstrap:68
```

I have the following packages installed in my package.config:

```
  "@fortawesome/fontawesome-free-webfonts": "^1.0.4",
  "@types/bootstrap": "^4.0.1",
  "@types/jquery": "^3.3.1",
  "bootstrap": "^4.0.0",
  "jquery": "^3.3.1",
  "popper.js": "^1.14.1"
```

This is the typescript code:

```
import "../scss/main.scss";
import * as $ from "jquery";
import 'bootstrap';

$(() => {
    $('[data-toggle="tooltip"]').tooltip();
    alert(sayHello("TypeScript"));
});
```

I imagine I also have to declare the `$` sign globally somewhere but this isn't documented in the bootstrap docs, but for me I can't seem to import the bootstrap js at all.

Is there something missing from the docs that I need to do? +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

Which might ofc be fine for you…

Just sayin’

Take care,
