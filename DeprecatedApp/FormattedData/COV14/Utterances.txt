However both projects are notably lacking in "Donate" buttons, and the SUIR site gives the impression - possibly false - that as it is used by Amazon and Netflix, there must be plenty of sponsor $$$.

However, this might have something to do with the fact that there are very few nudges to donate. There is a button right at the bottom of the entry webpage - but after you get to the docs, nothing (and you never go back to the main entry page, right?). There is no mention of donating on the GitHub readme, nor on the one for SUIR.

Seeing as it was possible to get $1M from kickstarter for some icons (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/232193852/font-awesome-5/), I'm just suggesting that there is maybe some untapped potential.

The one thing we need from you and @levithomason, DESPERATELY, is hopefully less than 20 minutes of your time to give 2 actively trusted people the power to add and remove privileged maintainers within this project and ideally within this organization. They should also have the power to add more administrators like themselves if needed. (Most privileged maintainers should not have such extra administrator power.)

I think this one action would be a MAJOR TECHNICAL LIFESAVER:
- prevent the otherwise inevitable project fork that is under discussion here, #6413, and #6109, among other places
- keep this project at the existing quality level
- avoid the dead project syndrome

By "project fork" I mean a significant portion of the team split off, like what happened with node.js in the past. I think it would be much better to keep this project as one united team if possible.

@jlukic I would like to commend you for the major efforts it must have taken on your part to get this project this far. I think we all understand 100% that you must be completely swamped with your professional work, business work for the project, and personal obligations.

The project needs lifesaving measures as it's community is dissatisfied enough to be discussing forks. I want to see this project live, and if forking it is the only way to get maintainers that then I'm behind it... You have good intentions for your project, and want to see it succeed. However, it's being smothered by inactivity and the inability of other members to step in. 

The `dead project syndrome` is already rearing it's head when pull requests to fix bugs are being auto-closed due to inactivity... I see new bug reports and KNOW that I can fix it, but why bother if it's for naught and the fix gets ignored. **I love Semantic UI**, and if this project where to come back to life would happily set aside a dedicated amount of time to find and fix issues on a regular basis. I've stopped paying attention to the project over the last year, and even explored other UI libraries because it no longer seems to be moving forward.

It's at a critical point now, other passionate members are literally begging for the ability to maintain a project they love. I'm sure they want to avoid a fork, we need active maintainers that can keep this project running while you are sorting out funding. There are even members trying to maintain their own forks/versions.

I think the final vision of UI requires a cohesive system for theming, layouts, & ui, with simple, unified integrations for all js frameworks, and a well-defined toolkit to extend & distribute additional components, share themes and track versions between teams.  

I think this is something I can produce and distribute open-source in the long-term, but will be a project much larger than SUI 2.x, and will require me pressing on for some time longer.

I hope people keep that vision in mind, when considering the near-term goals like providing prompt feedback directly on GitHub discussions, quick resolution for user-contributed PRs, maintenance releases etc. It hurts me that I'm not able to keep up the same pace as I had when 2.0 was launched.

I do continue to feel pretty disappointed that the active project ownership that is so badly is still not coming in the near term.

Giving all this things to other and keeping your time for deeping development may be win-win for all :
 - for you, cause you can use 100% time for your (great) goal
 - for community cause talented people are ready to help
 - for users cause they'll find answers and see project is alive and active (what's more frustrating / dissuasive for dev to see dead repo ? almost if they are professional dev or Decision-makers in enterprise).

It's one thing when the repo doesn't get any new commits from the owner. It's another where the owner stops being active altogether.

I do applaud that! ðŸŽ‰ I like ambitious goals. At the same time I must mention one thing: **you will not succeed on your own**.

In that regard I find it highly confusing - and disrespectful imho - that you chose to ignore all suggestions to delegate power to trusted contributors who would like to help you to maintain SUI 2.x. Which would _reduce_ your already high work load.

### Solving UI for the web

This task is too great to be solved by a single person. The key here is not to solely depend on your brainpower - instead, multiply by giving others authority. I know you know this. You already talked with others about splitting up the workload, but your actions currently tell another story.

If "Solving UI for the web" **truly** is your goal, then I'd advise you to rethink your stance on delegation. 

You already showed you have what it takes to do this! You built this awesome ship which *could* solve UI for the web. But it's gotten too big for you to micro manage every damn aspect of it. Let others help you with its navigation!
