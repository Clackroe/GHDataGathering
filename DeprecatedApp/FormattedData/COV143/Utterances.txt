ROOT +++$+++ SP13432626 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ 2015-12-20T14:52:31Z +++$+++ RTL text selection When trying to select a RTL substring, the highlighted text seems to be current but if you just press delete button, It will delete another part of the text instead of highlighted.

also double clicking on the text will highlight another word/part of text. 

It behaves like the position of the mouse is horizontally invert on the RTL text.

Simulate it:
First Test:
ÿß€åŸÜ €å⁄© ŸÖÿ™ŸÜ ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å ÿßÿ≥ÿ™
Select ÿß€åŸÜ With mouse down and mouse up and Press Delete button, and it will delete ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ instead of ÿß€åŸÜ:
ÿß€åŸÜ €å⁄© ŸÖÿ™ŸÜ ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å 

Second Test:
ÿß€åŸÜ €å⁄© ŸÖÿ™ŸÜ ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å ÿßÿ≥ÿ™
Double click on ÿ±ÿ≥€å
ÿ±ÿ≥€å will be Highlighted but if you press delete, ÿß€åŸÜ will be deleted.

COM7 +++$+++ SP273688 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM6 +++$+++ 2016-11-04T00:12:48Z +++$+++ Brackets is based on CodeMirror.
CodeMirror has bidi support with mild bugs; the main constraint is all
lines are left-aligned with LTR base direction:
https://codemirror.net/demo/bidi.html
There was a GSoC leading to experimental branch improving things,
including per-line direction, but it hasn't landed:
https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/two-new-experimental-branches-open-for-testing-mobile-and-direction/74
https://rawgit.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/direction/demo/bidi.html

Atom does not use CodeMirror, IIUC atom implemented their own editor
using electron.

COM8 +++$+++ SP150598 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM7 +++$+++ 2016-12-19T16:19:52Z +++$+++ Not a solution for "actual" RTL support (it probably even makes it very hard to read RTL text), but this way at least bidirectionality doesn't destroy the text (and selection) flow, so it's at least possible to work with files with bidirectional text:

~~`/* Bidirectional text is broken, so let's pretend it doesn't exist. */`~~
~~`atom-text-editor::shadow {`~~
~~`	.line {`~~
~~`		unicode-bidi: bidi-override;`~~
~~`	}`~~
~~`}`~~

**Edit 2017-01-12:**
Small update, because of the shadow DOM changes in 1.13.0, the following code should be added to the atom stylesheet instead:

```less
/* Bidirectional text is broken, so let's pretend it doesn't exist. */
atom-text-editor .line {
	unicode-bidi: bidi-override;
}

It's have way way more efficiency about typescript and tslint and as I can tell uses less resource in my ubuntu in compare to atom.
And finally as a Persian we have much better experience with VS code.
