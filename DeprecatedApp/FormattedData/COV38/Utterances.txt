I then wanted to copy that command text, so I highlighted it, then pressed ctrl + c but it doesn't appear to have copied the command text. I also tried ctrl + shift + c. Getting desperate I right clicked on the tab item itself, looking for a menu where I could select "copy" but no such menu seems to exist. I also tried right clicking with the text selected hoping for a menu where I could select "copy selection" but again no such menu exists. In desperation I gave up - copying text does not appear possible. What am I doing wrong?

The changes in #1093:

- set the default binding to `ctrl+shift+c`
- and even if we could rebind the default to `ctrl+c`, doesn't implement the copy-if-text-selected-or-send-ctrl+c semantics discussed in https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/pull/1093#issuecomment-498829169

I apologise if I've misread any of the code.

Nope, it wasn't. 

Making Ctrl+Shift+C the keybinding for copy is pointless. You may as well make it anything else Ctrl+P. People expect Ctrl+C and using anything except that will just make the copy feature undiscoverable.  +++$+++ 1 +++$+++ 2
COM17 +++$+++ SP10132417 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM16 +++$+++ 2019-08-06T13:54:36Z +++$+++ I couldn't agree more with @CobusKruger. 
Some things are just so common and expected, that not to use them just seems like you're actively hiding features from users. 
No one expects CTRL+SHIFT+C/V, They expect CTRL+C/V; If it were otherwise, there wouldn't be so many users here clamoring for it. 
CTRL+C/V is what should be in the json by default. 
This is very much a case of "Old Microsoft" rearing it's head, rather then new forward looking Microsoft.

@Panzerbjrn, please let me refresh you on the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). We can disagree here and have debates, but please halt yourself before assuming the motivations of others and attacking individuals personally or their work.

We are happy to continue to discuss the way that this prerelease product should evolve before it meets v1.0 (and even after 1.0!) Please exercise patience and understanding when working with us and members of the community as the software develops.

> [Gnome Terminal](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/txt-copy-paste.html) has a consistent keybinding that's not intuitive at first, but easy to adopt, and not too far from the usual <kbd>CTRL + C</kbd> for copy.
> <kbd>CTRL + C</kbd> : Cancel
> <kbd>CTRL + Shift + C</kbd> : Copy
> <kbd>CTRL + Shift + V</kbd> : Paste

This is the style of copy/paste keybindings for every other terminal on the planet, and the style we've chosen as the defaults. If you're unhappy with them, you're absolutely free to change them.  +++$+++ 2 +++$+++ 0

COM21 +++$+++ SP40315783 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM20 +++$+++ 2019-08-06T19:10:13Z +++$+++ I am so tempted to chime in with something more confrontational but I don't think it'll add to the debate so I'll just say this:

- The devs have been very responsive, and have been  accommodating of the many (often mutually conflicting) requests coming in from users. By this token the "old Microsoft" assertion seems unfounded and potentially disheartening for the people who have plowed a lot of work in to this.
- This is a beta product, if you expect it to meet all your needs straight away you probably need to realign your expectations.
- Some decisions will be made that won't work in your favour. Many won't work in my favour. However these are educated decisions made in the interest of supporting the average user (not just you), by talented devs who are acknowledging some compromise but are making pragmatic decisions nonetheless. By assuming your needs are paramount, you are potentially dismissing the needs of other users (e.g. WSL users like me who support the sensible decision to align with Gnome bindings and avoid escape sequence characters for default bindings).
- This is open source. If you feel you have the expertise to override their decisions, then you are free to implement changes in your own fork. If you don't have that expertise, you can't reasonably claim that the decision taken is actually wrong. "It's not what I'm familiar with" is probably not a good enough justification (in my view).

I won't reply to responses as I know it won't add anything and that I shouldn't have even posted the above, but I couldn't resist throwing my two cents in - sorry! +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
