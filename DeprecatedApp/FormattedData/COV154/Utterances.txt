-----

I have launched my app in playstore, but i have found so many crash after the app is opened.
And according my data on playstore, all crash happened in android 6.0. 
I have tried to testing in debug and released mode and everything is work. So this is strange for me.
So this crash decreases my rating on playstore. Flutter team please help me.

This is my data

Couple of questions, @bayuramadeza -- is this a regression from previous versions, or can you reproduce it on older builds? 

And are you able to narrow this down to a reproducible crash with a small sample? I'm not aware that we're seeing general issues with these devices, so it would be nice to know the source of this (could be Flutter itself, a plug-in, or something else, of course).  +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM5 +++$+++ SP32892647 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM4 +++$+++ 2019-07-31T03:04:11Z +++$+++ @timsneath yes this regression happened since i used appbundle in playstore. when i tried to remove any plugin and all code, then i uploaded it to playstore it's still happened. So, i rechecked anything but there is no something wrong. 
i just confused, why it's running in release mode with apk, but it crashed after internal teesting with appbundle? +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

- Uploaded as an APK with Flutter 1.7.4+hotfix.4, the app does not crash on these devices

Noticing, in case of building using appbundle, the device i'm using (Redmi Note 4 â€¢ android-arm64 â€¢ Android 6.0 (API 23)) gets strange apk of bundletool. Installed app is **much smaller** (installed app normal size is about 20Mb, while this app - about 3Mb), definitely missing native libs!

COM29 +++$+++ SP729934 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM28 +++$+++ 2019-10-04T23:03:55Z +++$+++ Thank you for the clarification.
If I understood correctly splitting per ABI with the current flutter build script is done by adding 1000/2000/3000/4000/5000 to the base build number.
This means it would start causing potential issues with a base build number above 1000. Even if it seems a relatively high number, it is currently not that high (we are already at build number 200 after 18 months of release cycles).
It's also important to pay attention when switching back to appbundle, as the build number needs to go above the highest build number already released.
Switching back and forth multiple times between these two modes is not trivial.
For this reason we have currently decided to release fat apks with binary code for both architectures, accepting a 8MB overhead in the size, hoping to see this bug solved soon. +++$+++ 3 +++$+++ 0
