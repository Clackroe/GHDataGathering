Sorry for that. I did not realize that IPython with that fix was not released yet. I usually test IPython completions before doing a Jedi release, but not this time :/. It will probably also not happen in the future anymore, because I'm going to release Jedi 1.0 soon, so this is probably the last time for a long time that you have to deal with deprecations in Jedi.

If I understand correctly from [this comment](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/12740#issuecomment-751273086) the problem has already been solved on master, but so far no release including the fix has been issued.
In order to better organize my own work, may I know when do you plan a new release? Somebody [here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/12740#issuecomment-751273584) was suggesting to quickly release 7.19.1, including this patch, is it still an option? +++$+++ 1 +++$+++ 0

note: in anaconda, this has to be done in the same kernel you're using from within the jupyter notebook, not the one you're using the `jupyter notebook` command from!

took me about 30 minutes to finally figure that one out once i found @davidhalter's pip install tip (i used `conda install jedi==0.17.2` instead of pip).

You can run Jupyter in one env and use it with a kernel from another env. See for example [this SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53004311/how-to-add-conda-environment-to-jupyter-lab). Jedi version of the latter env matters. If you are not aware of this, you probably use one conda env for jupyter and kernel. +++$+++ 1 +++$+++ 0
