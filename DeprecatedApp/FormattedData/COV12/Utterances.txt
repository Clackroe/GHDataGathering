Thank you for suggesting an idea to make Node.js better.

Please fill in as much of the template below as you're able.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
There was recently a decision to rename N-API to Node-API. I believe this is a poor decision that will result in actively harmful results for both users of the API and general Node.js users.

Specifically, there are multiple problems with this naming:

- Building APIs are a common use case for Node.js. This naming can lead to confusing information or misleading search results.
- Products often refer to the way to access their services with JavaScript or Node.js as their "JavaScript API". If people want to use this from Node.js, there is a non-trivial chance they will look for "Node.js API" which will lead to confusing results.
- Node.js itself has an API, which theoretically includes this API. Naming a part of the whole the same thing as the whole is immensely confusing from an education perspective.
- This API is far less likely to be used than other parts of the Ndoe.js API, which leads to an exacerbation of challenge presented by the problems above.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Rename Node-API to something else.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
- Undoing Node-API rename, moving it back to N-API. 
  -  There is a reason a rename was done initially, and that reason is valid.
- Leave it as is.
  - This is going to be actively harmful to communication and education n the long-run. +++$+++ 7 +++$+++ 0

The node-api team was asked to change the name in: https://github.com/nodejs/abi-stable-node/issues/420 . Being sensitive to the concern the team took on this extra work.

> I support changing the name N-API to something else, but the new term does have an obvious downside. The term "Node API" already has a straightforward meaning. Applying it to a specific API is more vague than descriptive.

I'll also add that `Node API` is somewhat contrary to our years-long efforts to have the name of the runtime spelled `Node.js` and not `Node` (or `NodeJS` or a number of other variatns). 

Of course, now that the name change has already happened, there are significant costs/downsides to changing the name a second time in such a short period of time. I'd still support it, though, if the name was more descriptive and not subject to misinterpretation. A better name is better for our users. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
