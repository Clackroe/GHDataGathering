This causes issues when shipping logs to Kibana in a logstash encoded format using the logstash-logback-encoder as println does not use that encoder. Is this done intentionally?

I did originally raise this issue here https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gatling/Kq-hDp3oFkk but got no response.

I'll sound pushy, but I think it would be fair that [billion dollars companies](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273693/bskybs-annual-revenue/) that have been using an open source software for years would consider helping the company behind the technology. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

Though I think it's unrealistic to expect someone/a company to pay money for a tool that works perfectly fine for them, just to have finer grain control over their logs.

We've drawn a clear line between what goes in Gatling OSS and what goes in Gatling FrontLine:
all new things related to stats/exports/integrations go into Gatling FrontLine.

We're more than happy with contributions related to core Gatling features such as HTTP and users orchestration. But we can't make any exception to the above rule. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM9 +++$+++ SP1058534 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM8 +++$+++ 2018-10-17T14:20:36Z +++$+++ @slandelle I am sorry but I don't really understand your reasoning, although I understand your concern around protecting the Enterprise value.

 Just to confirm, your strategy is to prefer for us to fork this project so that we can use a logger for a single line of code where you are currently using println, pushing us further away from wanting the Enterprise solution because you are classifying using a logger to output the summary as part of `stats/exports/integrations`, although that information is already being outputted in a different form?  

To be honest, this entire thread so far makes me far less inclined to introduce a dependency on the enterprise project.  I believe gatling is great as a project, I believe you should get paid to support and continue working on it full time, I also believe large companies should pay and help support opensource initiatives.   The problem is that I also believe your approach will alienate many people, or at least me and all the people I talk to about this.  It's a very simple code change, that actually makes it more consistent, as the majority of of your code base uses loggers (as any developer would expect). 

You are not even arguing about not outputting that data because it's `stats/enterprise` data.  The data is there and available in the logs already!  The only difference is the primitive output mechanism.  The fact that many modern log shipping frameworks expect json/structured logs means that using println automatically makes you a less attractive product for both enterprise and non enterprise adopters.  These println statements just create noise in most modern log shipping frameworks I have worked with as they cannot be interpreted as a single event.  This is genuine feedback.

I would urge you to reconsider the quick decision, because I believe this suggestion exposes no more information than you currently do, moves you towards a more standardized output like the rest of your code base, and would actually show you positively engaging in improving your entire product offering, OSS and Enterprise. 

The functionality you are planning as part of Enterprise are still attractive to companies like ours, e.g. aggregation of metrics etc, grafana datasources etc.  I think you've convinced yourself that any improvements to OSS is a risk to Enterprise.  Just doesn't sit well with me. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM10 +++$+++ SP849197 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM9 +++$+++ 2018-10-17T15:10:01Z +++$+++ @balooo Thank you for sharing your concerns. We don’t see improvements of the OSS as a risk, quite the contrary: you can have a look at all the work that’s been put into upcoming Gatling 3 OSS.

Our Enterprise version, Gatling FrontLine, aims to provide our users with advanced features in terms of metrics, integration and automation. This Enterprise version was designed by the feedback of our users who built their own integrations with Gatling but then struggled to stabilize them and maintain them over time.

We believe this Enterprise version is a win-win for everyone: we make you save time and money, we guarantee you stability and, at the same time, you help the open-source project continue to develop.

We would be more than happy to continue this discussion live and convince you that we are still committed to improve load testing, both for our OSS users and for our enterprise customers.

Anyway, thank you for using Gatling +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

I still don't understand how the suggested change is against your commercial strategy.  The points I was trying to articulate are that this request:

- doesn't expose any data that would previously be inaccessible / enterprise.
- doesn't suggest structuring the results in a way that is easier to parse/interpret programatically
- only suggests what we believe is better practice by outputting using a logger which is the standard practice
- would allow for common, modern log shippers to ship your output with our creating message noise, where each println is interpreted as a new log event.

I literally don't see a single reason you would be against it this request.  I've read through your comments multiple times and I still don't see a single argument you have given explaining why . 

> Sorry, but all new features regarding stats (additional stats, pushing stats elsewhere) fall into the scope of FrontLine, our Enterprise version.

Fair enough to that statement, but we're not talking about additional stats, pushing stats or anything about stats.  We're talking about not using a logger for your output which causes problems when using industry standard shipping practices that expect structured logs.

We have a consistent strategy regarding our open-source solution and our Enterprise version since the R&D started in 2015. We don't plan to change it for the moment, I hope you understand. Anyway, as I said before, we would be more than pleased to discuss this with you live.
