ROOT +++$+++ SP44085 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ 2021-01-25T10:40:48Z +++$+++ [Prototype] [Do NOT Merge] Binary Metal Archive Prototype for iOS/Mac. This patch wires up Metal Binary Archives for Mac and iOS. Metal Binary Archives
are used to cache pipeline state objects generated at runtime on the device and
serialize them to disk when rendering is paused. In this prototype, the binary
archives are serialized to disk when the application moves into the background.
On the next launch of the application, the serialized representation of the
archives is used for the creation of new pipeline state objects.

Per the [details in the linked issue][1], I do not recommend we land this patch.
This PR is just meant to be a record of the prototyping work done to evaluate
Metal Binary Archives for Flutter.

## Observations

Once patched in, the following observations can be made while running a Flutter application.

* After first launch, the application caches directory should contain a `.metallib` file with the following format. `flutter_engine_<engine_version>_<skia_version>_<index>.metallib`. This was done so any changes to the Flutter engine or the Skia version would not run the risk of using invalid cached contents. The file ([example](https://github.com/flutter/engine/files/5865817/flutter_engine_08daa2c8962687253fbcbd812d08d70c34c86721_069e484cc3b9518f115312c065a6f9c843b0839a_0.metallib.zip)) seems to be a Mach-O binary. This is consistent with Apple's recommendation that the `lipo` tool be used to combine archives harvested from devices of different GPU families.
* This file will get updated every time the application is backgrounded and will get reused when the application is launched.
* To prevent any issues with threading (I could find no mention in the docs about the thread safety aspects of any of the APIs) only raster thread operations will using this archive.
* One open question not answered in my linked comment was how much these archives would help for jank during subsequent application launches (as seeding the archive for first launch is a no-go). I tried to find determine this by making sure the cache was seeded and launching the application again. My hope was to see a reduction in the `GrMtlPipelineStateBuilder::finalize` trace in Observatory. This [did not materialize (trace is from a warmed up archive)](https://github.com/flutter/engine/files/5865862/warmed_cached_pipeline_state_extra_skia_traces.json.zip). This seems to be because the primary cause of jank in pipeline state setup is the construction of the Metal shader library (SKSL -> MSL -> MTLLibrary (AIR?)) and not the pipeline state object construction. An annotated version of one of the traces is as follows:

For sure, me and many others developers feel deceived about this situation, because Flutter team PROMISED 60 fps animation!

Indifference for the whole year! They decide to expand to the web and desktop, instead of contributing theirs main features and take care of community. That's why I tell, that "quantity over quality"

To be honest. Flutter being free in this case makes it only worse. I wish it was paid so we would not get the “it’s free, whatever you get be happy” response. At least we would not get a 100 line code commit after 1 year on such a huge issue. +++$+++ 7 +++$+++ 0

Caching the MSL has a few challenges:

- Apple doesn't seem to provide a good way to fetch the binary archives from the device/application for caching.
- It still has many disadvantages, such as not necessarily knowing when you'd need to do this, whether your cached shaders are still valid or not, whether you're missing an important one, etc.

We're trying to come up with a more comprehensive solution for this - one that would clearly let developers know when their scene might be complex enough to result in lengthy shader compilation, and what options they have to mitigate that. +++$+++ 1 +++$+++ 0

I recommend diving a bit deeper in the world of shaders an crossplatform GPU programming before making such a statement. Shaders have to be compiled before you can use them the first time. There is no way around it. So caching the compiled shaders is the usual way you do this.  My guess is that iOS native Apps use shaders that are already loaded by the operating system. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

The problem with this approach is you can't do it with a screen transition. I tried this even putting a hidden navigator behind the current screen with a stack and pushing/popping 3-5 times behind a loading screen, and it had no impact on the perceived jank after that. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

Very briefly, the need for shader compilation has to do with Flutter allowing you to dynamically create lots of different pixel configurations on the GPU. In theory, one could try to write a lot of that logic itself as a shader program, compile that "uber shader" once, and then never suffer from shader compilation jank during application run. In practice, that's extremely difficult to do correctly and may not even be possible to do performantly - shaders want to be small, well defined programs typically, and supporting everything that Flutter can do with such a program (on all the GPUs we have to support) is a very large problem space. Caching smaller programs can help, but it is not an ideal solution since different GPU/OS/driver versions can cause cache misses. This could be a problem even on iOS, where different phone/iPad models and iOS versions are in use. There are other design possibilities being considered as well.

As I said, we're working to come up with an overall better solution for this, but it's not an easy problem to deal with. This is considered an important issue by the team. We welcome contributions here as well, whether it's a patch or design proposals/feedback. +++$+++ 1 +++$+++ 0
