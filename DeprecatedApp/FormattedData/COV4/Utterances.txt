Ideally, I would like to have my changes merged here, so I have a few questions and concerns for my current port.

# Questions

**Should I target a specific C++ standard?**

Currently, my code depends on a few C++11 features, which can be easily removed with a few macros. This makes the code less readable, however, if C++03 support is desired, I will gladly change my implementation to conform to an older standard.

**How to handle Unicode filesystem support?**

Currently, LevelDB uses `char`-based (narrow) strings for for all filesystem operations, which does not translate well for Windows systems (since narrow strings use the ANSI, or OEM legacy codepages, and not UTF-8, for backwards compatibility). This means paths using international characters, or emojis, are therefore not supported with a simple port, something I consider to be an undesirable solution for a modern library. All the current forks of levelDB do not solve this fundamental issue, leading me to create my own implementation. Possible solutions include:

1. A narrow (UTF-8) API on *Nix, and a wide (UTF-16) API on Windows, using a typedef to determine the proper path type.
2. Converting all narrow strings from UTF-8 to UTF-16 before calling WinAPI functions.
3. Providing both a narrow (ANSI) and wide (UTF-16) API on Windows.

The 2nd option, although the least amount of work, is the least amenable for me since the expected encoding for paths from levelDB would then conflict with the entirety of the WinAPI. The 3rd option, however, duplicates code to support both the narrow and wide WinAPI, which would increase the amount of work required to maintain levelDB. The first option is a happy median: it minimizes redundancy and is consistent with expectations about *Nix and Windows paths. I am, however, amenable to any suggestions the levelDB authors may have.

**Intellectual Property**

To emulate the behavior of `mmap` on Windows, I used a very lightweight library (<250 lines of code) from Steven Lee, [mman-win32](https://github.com/witwall/mman-win32). However, looking over your contributor license agreement, it seems that my port would not satisfy Google's CLA until I remove this code from my implementation. If this is the case, I could easily use the raw WinAPI functions rather than the emulated `mmap` in my Windows port. Please notify me if I should remove this code prior to submitting a pull request.

# Other Changes

**CMake Build System**

I introduced a CMake build system, which retains most of the same logic as the existing Makefile. The existing Makefile has not been deprecated.

**AppVeyor Continual Integration**

To ensure builds do not break the Windows builds, I am planning to add an AppVeyor configuration, which allows continual integration on Windows using MSVC.

# Summary

If there is still interest for native Windows support, and the proposed changes are amenable to the levelDB authors, I would gladly submit a pull request. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

We haven't made a decision w.r.t. this yet, so it will be easiest if it
does not rely on on c++03 only.  Would it be a big problem to do so?

Here is what I suggest: make a separate Env implementation for Windows
(instead of attempting to reuse env_posix.cc).  That Env implementation
(like all other Env implementations), accepts char-based (narrow) strings,
which are always utf8 encoded.  Inside this Env's implementation, it can
convert back and forth between the utf8 strings that the rest of leveldb
assumes, and whatever type is appropriate for windows APIs called in the
implementation.

If there is significant code in env_posix.cc you find yourself needing,
consider refactoring that out into a separate .h/.cc (which are private to
the leveldb implementation) so you can share the code in your Env
implementation.

Yes, this should be removed.  In general, we have been throttling back mmap
usage anyway (it helps a bit with microbenchmarks, but causes a bunch of
portability problems).  So I suggest a good initial start will be to just
use raw WinAPI functions.

This sounds very useful to me.  I would like it if the changes were limited
to the following:

(a) A windows Env implementation as I mentioned above.
(b) Build/portability changes.

Is that feasible, or you are seeing the need to make widespread changes?

As a soon-to-be user of the leveldb Windows support (for Mesos), here are are my thoughts:

> Should I target a specific C++ standard?

For us, C++11 is fine, we already target this.

> How to handle Unicode filesystem support?

This is an annoying problem, I had to fix this for Mesos. I went with:

> 2. Converting all narrow strings from UTF-8 to UTF-16 before calling WinAPI functions.

It also leads into long path issues on Windows. I took an approach similar to the one CMake took for their Windows port, a `longpath` helper to translate all paths as they reach WinAPI functions from UTF-8 to UTF-16 with `\\?\` prepended if necessary. My helper is [here](https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/3rdparty/stout/include/stout/internal/windows/longpath.hpp) (note that the max path is _not_ 255 despite documentation).

I need to stress: native long path support is probably a must for most Windows projects nowadays. It's not terribly difficult to do, it's just _really annoying_.

Also, for your comment:

> is the least amenable for me since the expected encoding for paths from levelDB would then conflict with the entirety of the WinAPI

I'm not sure I entirely agree, there is no data loss going from UTF-8 to UTF-16. Both encodings are _Unicode_, it's just an implementation difference. Plus, you can do the conversion [natively in C++11](https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/f599839bb854c7aff3d610e49f7e5465d7fe9341/3rdparty/stout/include/stout/stringify.hpp#L57). Anyway, I've not had any problems on Windows having gone this route so far.

Specifically, I've had 3 major issues:

1. ~~`issue178_test` fails intermittently. ~10% of the time, it succeeds, without issue. 25% of the time, it produces a slightly lower number of keys than the 1.1m requires (almost always greater than 1.09m). The rest of the time, it produces the error `Assertion Failed: r->options.comparator->Compare(key, Slice(r->last_key)) > 0, file level-db\table\table_builder.cc, line 97`.~~

2. ~~`db_test` fails intermittently (at about the same frequency) during the `random_read_counter_` section (from `env_->random_read_counter_.Reset();` to `ASSERT_LE(reads, N + 2*N/100);`~~

3. ~~Most severely though, however, is the multi-threaded section seems to produce the `bad block type` error consistently, which would defeat the entire purpose of a multi-thread access.~~

Otherwise, all the test cases and benchmarks work. Just a heads up for the major delay.

(Items with ~~strikethrough~~ have been patched).

COM10 +++$+++ SP9440903 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM9 +++$+++ 2017-11-07T10:16:57Z +++$+++ Everything has been patched, and I am adding extended file length support currently. @andschwa, for the extended file length support, since the `"\\?\"` prefix effectively removes all path parsing, do you know if there's anything else I need to consider other than:

1. Relative paths (which cannot use the extended file length prefix).
2. `/`, `.`, or `..` in paths (somewhat tricky, see below).

For the `.` and `..` operators, manually parsing them is somewhat tricky, since directory symbolic links may be in play. The only time-tested strategy for this is to iterate over all roots, parent directories, check to see if the item is a directory symbolic link or junction, get the real path of the directory if it is a symlink or junction, and then continue from there. This is because `C:\leveldb\..\leveldb-1\README.md` does not actually point to `C:\leveldb-1\README.md` if `C:\leveldb` is a symlink or junction.

This is very doable (and is relatively easy to implement), but it is fairly expensive since it requires filesystem calls. It requires a temporary vector to store each path component. Step-wise, the general approach is as follows:

1. Check if the path is absolute (skip remaining steps otherwise).
2. Replace all forward separators with backslashes.
3. Recurse over each parent directory, from the root (drive letter, such as `C:`, or UNC root, such as `\\host-name\share-name`), to the (and excluding the) file (we don't care if the file is a symlink, since relative path components cannot follow it).
4. If the directory basename is `.`, ignore the directory.
5. If the directory basename is `..`, remove the preceding directory component.
6. Otherwise, check if the directory is a symlink by calling `CreateFile` with the `FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT` and `FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS` flags. If the handle is successfully created, it's a symlink, otherwise, it is not.
7. If the directory is a symlink, read the proper path using `DeviceIoControl` with the `FSCTL_GET_REPARSE_POINT` code, and reset the vector using the absolute new path.

I would be amenable to implementing this (I've done this before, as may be obvious due to the detail of my explanation on how to implement such functionality), but this may add a lot of expense for a feature that application developer should have to be aware of themselves (that is, leveldb will already support an extended length path, if provided by the end-user).

Another major caveat is leveldb's filenames are short (the longest being the `MANIFEST-00000X` files, at 15 characters). Since the Windows [documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx) clearly states the maximum directory length must be `MAX_PATH - 12`, even with the extended length path prefix, this seems like a lot of work for an added 3 characters.

@pwnall, any thoughts? Should extended file length support be added, including with the caveats mentioned above? +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

Re: bullet 6: I'm using this logic in Mesos:

```
  const DWORD access_flags = resolved_path_is_directory
    ? (FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT | FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS)
    : FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT;

  const HANDLE handle = ::CreateFileW(
      longpath(absolute_path).data(),
      GENERIC_READ,     // Open the file for reading only.
      FILE_SHARE_READ,  // Just reading this file, allow others to do the same.
      nullptr,          // Ignored.
      OPEN_EXISTING,    // Open existing symlink.
      access_flags,     // Open symlink, not the file it points to.
      nullptr);         // Ignored.
```

adding the `FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS` flag only if its a directory. I also specifically use `OPEN_EXISTING`, though you probably got that.

Re: point 7: I resolve the path using `GetFinalPathNameByHandleW` with the `FILE_NAME_NORMALIZED` flag, after using:

```
  const DWORD access_flags = resolved_path_is_directory
    ? FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS
    : FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL;

  const HANDLE handle = ::CreateFileW(
      longpath(absolute_path).data(),
      GENERIC_READ,     // Open the file for reading only.
      FILE_SHARE_READ,  // Just reading this file, allow others to do the same.
      nullptr,          // Ignored.
      OPEN_EXISTING,    // Open existing file.
      access_flags,     // Open file, not the symlink itself.
      nullptr);         // Ignored.
```

to get a handle to the file/directory at the resolved path.

Re:

I agree that just letting the end-user provide `\\?\C:\long\paths` without any extra handling from `leveldb` might be just fine, so long as _all_ the Windows APIs used are the Unicode versions (and specifically listed as supporting long paths; though this is most of them). +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
