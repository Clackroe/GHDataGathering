Lot of software developers are discussing on twitter to rename default branches for their projects from "master" to "main" or equivalent https://twitter.com/search?q=master%20branch&src=typed_query

The primary reason being master-slave an oppressive metaphor.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Node.js core follows the trend to change the industry standard, and renames default branch from "master" to "main" or similar

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Sticking with existing master branch name for the default

If someone from the project's base does feel strongly about it - I suggest we rename it, though `master` is the default git branch name so I would caution we pick our battles.

I vote we:
 - Don't change the name from master to something else currently.
 - Change it when a contributor/collaborator feels strongly enough about this.

I don't feel strongly against using master branch name. I proposed it as I plan to follow it in my personal projects and work projects, and wanted to ask Node.js community.

Should we add this to tsc-agenda?

If not, we should create one.

I'm not sure where the git repo is - but I recommend trying the mailing list and asking there https://git-scm.com/community 

I think "doing whatever git does and bringing the issue to their attention" is a viable strategy - but again, I don't feel particularly strongly about the use of "master" and if someone else does - sure.

As far as I understand it that's not how our governance works. Any collaborator may add the `tsc-agenda` label for an issue so it gets TSC eyes on it - but that should only be done if consensus seeking fails. It's an escape hatch for when we need to _force a vote_ which is pretty rare. At least that is my understanding of [the process](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md).

So far everyone here seems to be pretty in sync (no one is opposed but no one is particularly in favor). We're not even in disagreement ðŸ˜… +++$+++ 3 +++$+++ 0

COM13 +++$+++ SP45469 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM12 +++$+++ 2020-06-13T20:14:47Z +++$+++ Bear in mind that URLs linking to `master` will not redirect to the new default branch name (and for repos where it matters, which isn't this one, github-pages only works on the default branch when it's named `master`). It may be worth waiting for Github to fix these discrepancies before making the switch.

Does anyone object to changing this (just the main branch name from `master` to `main`)?

It looks like it's [not particularly hard](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/33864#issuecomment-643656288) technically (+ an update to the collaborator guide and policy). We probably need to address [the links](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/33864#issuecomment-643672588) as well.
