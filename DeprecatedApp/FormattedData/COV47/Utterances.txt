Many libraries in the Angular ecosystem publish to NPM from a subdirectory that was cooked during the build process. The process is usually as followed:
- build the library in a subdirectory (i.e `dist` directory)
- copy package.json, license and readme to the `dist` directory
- do some package.json cleanups in the `dist` directory (delete devDepedencies, move dependencies to peerDependencies, remove scripts...)
- npm publish from the `dist` directory.

I understand that it is not a common technique for node.js package developers but i think it is common for web package developers and my libraries uses the same technique..

While embedding `lerna` into our shared packages monorepo - [kaltura-ng](https://github.com/kaltura/kaltura-ng) I read a lot of issues in lerna and googled about this topic. I read carefully the conversation of issue #91 and even used the same subject with my issue. Unless I missed new issues that address this feature it was marked as 'wontfix' with a recommendation to use the 'package.json:files' array instead.

The reasons for using this approach instead of `package.json:files` array are:
- Many known libraries in the Angular ecosystem does it ([angular/angular](https://github.com/angular/angular), [ReactiveX/rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs), [cyclejs/cyclejs](https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs)) so they must have a reason.
- There is a lot of hoo-ha/complexity with the way node.js resolve modules  for the **web projects** since during the bundling process you **must** refer to the same instance of the library. Unless the bundler (typescript, webpack etc...) provide a hack/workaround/solution to force the library to use its' own node_modules, it will not work. Publishing from sub-directory works just because the `dist/node_modules` not exists.
- During development if the symlink is done against the root, when you import nested class which was not exported in the main index, you will need to refer to the `dist` as part of the path `import { something } from 'my-package/dist/something`. but once you publish from `dist` folder directly, you should somehow fix the pass by removing the `dist` during the tranpiling which is not a valid option.
- The libraries being used as dependencies during development should be assigned as peerDependencies at runtime because you want the application to provide them.

so to recap, we cannot just publish the package with a `dist` folder, we need to publish from `dist` directly

There are some caveats that I could think about with my suggested approach:
1. The dist folder must exists with a package.json inplace before the `lerna bootstrap` process symlink the folders. 
2. The build process should not delete the 'dist' folder, instead it should just clear its content otherwise the symlink of dependent libraries will be broken.

IMO those two caveats are manageable as:
1. we can use a preinstall script to create the folder and a simple package.json file (with at least 'id','name').
2. the build scripts should clear the folder content instead of `rm -rf` the folder itself.
 
## Expected Behavior
<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->
<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->
when bootstrapping/publishing a package the package.json is being queried for the following config:

```
"config" : {
	"npmDistDirectory" : "dist"
},
```

if this config exists, it will symlink to that folder during bootstrap command and will publish from that folder during  publish command

using the 'config' attribute allow using the same configuration both in `lerna` and in other [node scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#config).
 
I already modified the 'bootstrap' command in a fork [esakal/lerna](https://github.com/esakal/lerna). I didn't create a PR yet because I'm missing the 'publish' command. I will be happy to continue my work if you are going to consider this feature.

You can see it in action in our repo -  [kaltura-ng](https://github.com/kaltura/kaltura-ng) :
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kaltura/kaltura-ng.git
$ yarn
$ npm run setup
$ cd kaltura-ui/node_modules/@kaltura-ng
$ ll # you should see a symlink to kaltura-common/dist and kaltura-client/dist
```
**NOTE** - your yarn version should be 0.24.6 and above

Especially nowadays with ES module exports and whatnot combined with tree-shaking module bundlers, there’s really no fundamental _necessity_ for false-basedir publishing.

Lerna is designed around the way npm works. Packages are published from the same directory as the package.json, and construct their tarball from metadata contained therein. Publishing from a different directory with a modified dependency tree is not idiomatic npm, and lerna will not support it.

I myself want to publish from a subdirectory which does contain a `package.json` for several reasons;

1) I don't want to transpile my TS in the `src` folder because I'll end up having a messy file system. `.ts`, `.metadata.json`, `.js`, `.d.ts` all next to each other, and than to `clean` after build will be a total mess.
2) I want to following Google's Angular Package format https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZC2rcpxffTDfRDs6p1cfbmKNLA6x5O-NtkJglDaBVs/preview
3) Seperation of concerns, why should I have my `dist` files within the same folder of the `src`?

My folder structure
```bash
-- my-lib
---- package.json
---- src
------ index.ts

I was able to solve it by leveraging the `preversion`, `version`, and `postversion` scripts that were added in https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/774

For me I got it working by:
- Disabling NPM publishing during the lerna publish command
  - `lerna publish --skip-npm`
- Performing my linting and build during the `preversion` NPM script (or before) which would be built into a `dist` folder
- Copy necessary files into the `dist` folder during the `postversion` NPM script and then call `npm publish dist`. This is handled in a gulp file but I've simplified below.
  - The `package.json` version has been bumped prior to the `postversion` script being called
  - `postversion` is only called if you do not include the `--skip-git` command to lerna publish
  - `"postversion": "cp package.json dist && npm publish dist"`

I still think a config option for `npmDistDirectory` could be beneficial since it would allow a consumer to leverage the `prepublish` lifecycle-hook which seems a little more intuitive. +++$+++ 4 +++$+++ 0

It is not necessary this to be agains anything related to `npm` but the lack of changes on npm itself. 2018 most of the packages uses specific folder for the compiled version of the package, webpack does it, babel community suggest it, parcel does it, rollup community suggest it.

So why could just see the need of this?

You can tell npm what folders/files to put inside a package via the [files](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#files) param. I never tried it for sub-directories, but if I got what you are aiming at this could be enough to solve the mentioned problem right? +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

Based on what you can say that?

```js
// factory1.js

export const perform = () => {
  return 'factory1'
}
```

```js
// factory2.js

```

```js
// pkg.main: main.js

export * from './factory1'
export * from './factory2'
```

because you can't do the previous example you will end up requiring specific file

```js
// somefile.js

import * as Something from 'libname/factory2'

console.log(
  Something.perform()
)
```

So, based on what you can assume that you are right saying that the package is too big? 

What will be your argument that I have to pay attention to re-exporting on the main file?

Well, I wouldn't re-export anything if that is your case, the whole point of having files that behave as a module scope in NodeJS.

Could you show me how to resolve this issue please?

Having one function package so you will end up with 100 dependencies when they can live all together in the same package?

Expanding on what @noherczeg mentioned, this is possible with the `main` and/or `files` options within `package.json`

```
// example package.json

main: 'dist/index.js',
files: ['dist'],

Let say your files were all under a `dist` folder. A consumer could retrieve the files in the following way:

```
import * as Everything from 'package';
import * as FactoryOne from 'package/dist/FactoryOne';
import * as FactoryTwo from 'package/dist/FactoryTwo';
etc.

There is no _technical_ difference between the code above and 

```
import * as Everything from 'package';
import * as FactoryOne from 'package/FactoryOne';

Yes, I am aware of that but that but when you use a folder it will just copy the file inside the folder name so `files: ["lib"]` it will put the files inside `lib`

Ones comes from `lib` and the other comes from the root of the project. 

Ideologically, yes you are right, there is not differences (maybe, who knows, this is based on the situation).

Technically,

There is a different indeed, in fact, I could have `package/FactoryOne` and `package/lib/FactoryOne` in the same project and have for whatever reason differences between each other.
