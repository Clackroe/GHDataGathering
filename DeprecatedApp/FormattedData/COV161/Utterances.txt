Sure it would git push when he didn't want it to, but clearly it was working before. Unless, Lerna added some better error checking and this is an error that the command specified doesn't exist and it just didn't error out before, but that's probably still a break if bad commands worked before. 

EDIT -

Removing the `git` in `--no-git-push` fixed the above command, but I still think it might be worth having somewhere in the release notes that bad commands will now error out instead of just being ignored.  +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

When exactly did I say that, @tkissing-work?

* If you're not using a lockfile, then the only one to blame for your builds breaking "without warning" is yourself.
* If you _are_ using a lockfile, then it was an explicit change you made (upgrading `lerna`) that caused the breakage, not a dastardly plan on my part to cause you pain.

The fact remains that the long-standing _intention_ of `lerna`'s argument parsing was to be strict, throwing errors when unrecognized options were passed. There was a bug in yargs 12 that silently perverted this intention, and yargs 14 fixed it. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

"I'd say that's much worse than" sounds like you did me a favor, but all I got was extra work.

> If you are using a lockfile, then it was an explicit change you made (upgrading lerna) that caused the breakage

The whole point of SemVer is that this "explicit change" can be made by a machine. The author of a library categorized upgrades into breaking and non-breaking. Software like renovate can then pick certain updates and apply them automatically based on this categorization.

> If you're not using a lockfile, then the only one to blame for your builds breaking "without warning" is yourself.

The condescending attitude aside, a lockfile alone does not help here. Updating lerna necessarily means my lockfile changes. My direct usage of yargs was "protected" by the lockfile, because the selector `yargs@^12.0.1` still gave me 12.0.5 at `node_modules/yargs/`. But without forced hoisting (and thus forced conflict resolutions) that has no impact on what is in `node_modules/lerna/node_modules/yargs/`

> not a dastardly plan on my part to cause you pain

I am not saying you planned this.
Your update broke something for some consumers without being SemVer major. That is unfortunate, but it's a mistake that can happen. 
However, your reaction to the mistake being brought to your intention is somewhere between condescending and hostile.
You could have said "sorry, this was not intended, let me roll back and re-release as 4.0.0" and it would be fine.
You could have said "sorry, I didn't consider that the yargs API practically becomes part of the lerna API, I will make sure that future SemVer major updates of yargs only happen in SemVer major updates of lerna"
Instead you said that it's good that your mistake broke my build.
