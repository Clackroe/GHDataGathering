Upgraded a couple of days ago Unity to 2017.1, HoloToolkit to MixedRealityToolkit release 1 and Visual Studio to 2017 and cannot compile under VS with the guideline workflow :

So am switching back to previous HoloToolkit packages and will try your MixedRealityToolkit release 2 when it will be available. Lost 2 days ^^ +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM1 +++$+++ SP13334553 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM0 +++$+++ 2017-08-23T15:48:59Z +++$+++ @Xispeo, what version of Visual Studio are you using? 

Also for your first issue, did you make sure to switch your build settings back to UWP?  It looks like you're missing/didn't install the windows universal module for unity.

For the second issue, Visual Studio 2017 is required for the latest versions of this project.
Keep in mind this [known issue w/Visual Studio 2017.3 and all current Releases of Unity](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/issues/860). +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM2 +++$+++ SP28380770 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM1 +++$+++ 2017-08-24T06:41:54Z +++$+++ I also happened with such problemï¼Œit confused me for two days. I had reinstalled VS2017 with 15.3 for many times,but it didn't work. I also tried to update the Unity , but the old project can't be opened without any questions. I had a very long way to find the solution(I also tried VS2015) . At last the VS2017 with 15.0 and the unity 5.6.2 works well in my computer, that is my way to solved this problem. I wish it may be helpful. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM3 +++$+++ SP31275185 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM2 +++$+++ 2017-08-24T08:02:35Z +++$+++ @StephenHodgson as indicated in my previous posts I tried with both VS 2017 and 2015. Universal module is installed, am not a newcomer with Hololens since I develop since a year on it, and have a project to get ready for an incoming demo. Sounds like there are problems with last Unity version and the toolkit.

@TinyTangS ty for your feedback, will help :) +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM4 +++$+++ SP31275185 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM3 +++$+++ 2017-08-24T09:12:04Z +++$+++ Ok am sorted with Unity 5.6.3, HoloToolkit 1.5.8 and VS 2015.
Will try to update when next iterations of both Unity and MixedRealityToolkit will get released since I don't have the time to betatest atm. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM5 +++$+++ SP33959610 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM4 +++$+++ 2018-04-04T14:51:48Z +++$+++ I just dont get why is allways so complicated to even do anything with the Hololens. Do you think they will thrive give all this errors and problems? Im just sickk of having to go through thousnads of tutorials, forums, chats, emails and so on every time Unity updates, or the HoloToolkit or the MRDL or visual studio... It is just SUPER UNSTABLE and a serious pain in the *** to do anything. I think Hololens will fail miserably due to all the constant difficulties.
BTW I was compiling no problem this afternoon, until sudenly it started throwing errors ive never seen before. Hope Holelns V.2 never come out. Seriously. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

Yeah, there's been issues from the manufacturer, all the way through to the middle ware game engine, and even here in the community trying to solve the problems. (odd thing is that's what keeps me around ðŸ˜… ).

Please keep in mind this is a Gen1 device, that was never really intended to go beyond developers who wanted to play with it, and companies wanting to do a feasibility test.

This quote couldn't be any more true, especially when it comes to software. The nice thing is that it's a continuous process to grow and learn, and they only way you really know that it's happening is when you make mistakes.  I'm glad to see the software getting better (and it has!).  Microsoft, Unity, and even the Toolkit have come a long way in the last two years.

I agree it is a pain, but I think the difference here is that you haven't talked to me, or other engineers trying to make your life easier by fixing some of the problems. This is the first time I've heard from you, so **let's open a new issue and try to figure out what's going on**.
