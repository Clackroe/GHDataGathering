<pre>
$ go version
go version go1.12.7 windows/amd64
</pre>

### Does this issue reproduce with the latest release?

Yes.

### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?

Applies to all OSes

### What did you do?

1. Mounted a UNC path as a drive letter.
2. In CMD, switched the current working directory to that drive.
3. Called filepath.Abs on a relative path.
4. Called filepath.EvalSymlinks on the result of that function.

### What did you expect to see?

The same results as calling GetFinalPathNameByHandle: a UNC path.

### What did you see instead?

A path using the drive letter instead of the UNC path.

### Notes

This affects any attempt to canonicalize paths using the output of Git in such a situation.  Git produces some paths as absolute and some paths as relative, and uses GetFinalPathNameByHandle for canonicalizing absolute paths.  However, Go lacks a function to canonicalize paths in a standard way, so it isn't possible to produce results equivalent to a C program and still write code that works portably across systems.

Go should add a function that is explicitly defined to canonicalize paths in a way equivalent to the underlying operating system, since using filepath.Abs and filepath.EvalSymlinks doesn't work correctly on Windows.  It does work fine on Unix, but Unix paths are much simpler and easier to reason about.

It was determined in #17084 that filepath.Abs and filepath.EvalSymlinks were sufficient in this case, but that doesn't appear to be true.  I expect there are other cases in which those don't work on Windows, but I am insufficiently versed in Windows paths to know what those are.

I did not try it, but, I suspect, UNC paths wouldn't work in some situations. For example, can you pass UNC path to os.Chdir?

Is there any interest in fixing this?  Right now, there is no cross-platform way to canonicalize a path in Go.

However, I do feel firmly that this functionality should be in the standard library, since it is in almost every other language, and it is in POSIX.  I don't want to carry a lot of platform-specific code in a program because it's difficult to maintain and test, especially when I don't typically develop on Windows.

If Go is known to have known defects on Windows, those should be promptly fixed or clearly documented.  For many purposes, it's fine if code doesn't run or run well on Windows, but there are some cases where it does.  The documentation should clearly and prominently list any limitations with using Go on Windows so that folks can make an informed decision.  Last I checked, the `filepath` documentation didn't indicate such limitations, and hasn't for some time.

Normally, when I find a bug or missing feature, I would send a patch to implement that functionality.  However, Go has a CLA, and I don't sign CLAs, so any patch I might submit wouldn't be accepted.  If that changes, I'm happy to send a patch to implement this properly if nobody gets to it before me. +++$+++ 3 +++$+++ 0

On Windows, there are many ways to have indirection in a path: symlinks, junctions, SUBST, etc.  (I don't actually know all of the possible ways, since I almost never use Windows).  The canonical form uses none of those indirections and uses the canonical case.

- You linked to #40180 which is making a general software engineering argument along the lines of "you should never actually replace all the symlinks, that's violating the abstractions that have been set up". I have some sympathy for that, but if it were true, it would apply not just to EvalSymlinks but also this issue as well. If so, then we should just close this very issue (#37113) as a terrible idea.

- I see that you mentioned this issue in #40966, which is about some problems with path lengths in EvalSymlinks on Windows. We've had path length problems elsewhere on Windows. Path length issues are usually pretty straightforward to fix. Why would we want to gate a fix to #40966 on a larger design discussion on this issue?

- Finally, you said, with no links at all, "This proposal should probably also deprecate EvalSymlinks, which is seriously broken on Windows." How is it broken? That comment would be a good place for an issue link.

More generally, it's required to determine definitively if a path is under a directory, which has a wide variety of general-purpose applications outside of Git.  Whether other people think it is useful in their projects, path canonicalization is commonly used and is almost always provided by the standard library.  Canonicalizing paths is [also recommended by CMU's secure coding guidelines](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/FIO02-C.+Canonicalize+path+names+originating+from+tainted+sources); while those are for C, there's no reason to think Go is any different.

@bk2204, I'm certainly not arguing against this functionality. I'm trying to understand why EvalSymlinks shouldn't be what provides this functionality on Windows.

(I do somewhat object to the name "canonical": if "/home/rsc" symlinks to some device path like "/u123/g3tah0uojq1/rsc", I have a hard time calling the latter the "canonical" one. And for what it's worth there are plenty of people who disagree with you about what "determine definitively if a path is under a directory" should mean. I have the bug reports to prove it. :-) But again, I'm not saying we shouldn't do this. I just think EvalSymlinks is probably the answer.) +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

It would need to keep doing what it's documented to do, namely preserve relative-ness to current directory when possible. That means calling GetFinalPathNameByHandle and fixing up the result a little. But we could still build a function around GetFinalPathNameByHandle that should handle everything Windows can throw at it.

`EvalSymlinks` should not be fixed but replaced. `GetFinalPathNameByHandle` *always* returns an absolute path. Paths with `\\?\` syntax are always absolute.

The CMU guidance obviously is written without considering the arguments against `EvalSymlinks` that I wrote up - which is based on guidance from Microsoft, so I don't quite agree with your conclusion that resolving file system driver paths is a proper thing to do while canonicalizing. I have just hastily scanned that document from CMU and I don't immediately see they say you should resolve links. They just mention links could be present for awareness.

I have written quite a bit of software and I have never considered writing checks like that. Usually path checks involve checking whether they are in some base path - for which `Rel` is better than `EvalSymlinks`. Sure you can ask for a properly cased path and/or fix slashes, but otherwise, why write string handling or comparisons at all? Paths usually come from somewhere. I mean from the working directory, from configuration or perhaps from user input in most cases. Usually those are already trusted without doing any checks. Or they are built from system settings, which are also trusted. That might be circumstantial evidence against your conclusion based on that article but still.

Also about the Git example still I think the application should be in control of which links get resolved. Some of the links that make up a path used by Git could still be system administrator controlled which makes it wrong to resolve them and the result dependant on system configuration. Like for my system - most Git paths ran through `EvalSymlinks` on my system will (have to) be volume GUID paths (and hence again all always absolute). But Git should never care about that or go that deep. It's wrong.

That's not true on modern POSIX systems.  You can open a file descriptor to a directory and operate on a path relative to that file descriptor with the `*at` series of functions.  It may be true on Windows.

I agree with some of your points and I've stated so above.  Users usually are not interested in canonical paths.  It's also wrong to use path canonicalization in a case where the possibility of changing path resolution leads to a security problem or buggy behavior.  That's a well known problem on Unix systems and Windows is no different.

It is irrelevant to me whether the path is created with a drive letter or not, so I have no position on that argument.

I agree that `EvalSymlinks`, as it exists today, is broken on Windows and does not do anything interesting or useful in most cases.  That's why I opened this issue.

The question is not whether you think this feature is valuable.  You need not use it.  The question is whether Go ought to provide access in a portable way to cross-platform functionality that every operating system and every other major language provides and which is used in many projects for good and valuable reasons, and which, even if used imprudently, is required for compatibility with other software already existing for longer than Go has.  The fact that major organizations like CMU recommend this practice is evidence that this feature is important and valuable, even if you disagree.

Path canonicalization is even more important on Windows than Unix because Windows has case-folding behavior in its file system that depends on attributes related to when the file system was created.  It is therefore impossible without the kernel's help to know the proper name of a file and whether two file names actually refer to the same item on disk, and Windows otherwise lacks the concept of device and inode numbers which are normally used to perform this check on Unix.

I have seen first hand how Git broke when it did not canonicalize paths consistently, and I still have a broken repository on my system from that point.  I am a core contributor to Git and the primary driver of the SHA-256 transition.  I've developed in situations where symlinks and path resolution have important and subtle security implications.  I understand the problem space intimately and why Git has the behavior it does.  Please don't try to to tell me that Git's behavior is wrong here, because it is not.  Whether a path is created by the user, the system administrator, or any other actor does not change whether canonicalization is necessary. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

Obviously that is the same on any operating system if you just use `Rel` and `Join`. But `EvalSymlinks` makes the path relative to the current working directory and it is that fact that makes it not thread-safe. You can use `Join` but again you need the current working directory as argument, which might have changed in between these two calls.

> The question is not whether you think this feature is valuable. You need not use it.

My argument is not against canonicalization, but against using or fixing `EvalSymlinks` to do it. This whole comment was about using `GetFinalPathNameByHandle` to implement `EvalSymlinks`. It can't be done properly.

>  Windows otherwise lacks the concept of device and inode numbers

There is the concept of object identifiers, but these are an NTFS concept. So yeah sure absolutely, the OS needs to be involved and one of the things that is wrong with `path\filepath` is that it doesn't involve the OS enough.

> Please don't try to to tell me that Git's behavior is wrong here, because it is not.

I don't know what Git does, but I really think it is wrong to resolve all links - even those that are in a parent directory of the Git repo. The issue linked specifically mentions the ability to have files open while these links are being changed and to continue to open files afterwards as long as these links are not in any way, for any length of time, cached. I don't mean to criticize your intimate knowledge and experience with Git development, but the proper way to go is to know which links are part of repository configuration and which ones are system configuration and leave the latter ones forever unresolved. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

For (1), EvalSymlinks is _already_ defined to return an absolute path when necessary. If the result of GetFinalPathNameByHandle cannot be made relative to the current directory, then the absolute one can be returned. That's entirely within the documented behavior.

For (2), there's nothing wrong with relative paths per se provided the process is not calling os.Chdir. It is Chdir (the write operation) that is not "thread-safe", not the relative path evaluation (the read operations). If you have a program that uses Chdir, then yes, use absolute paths. Pass an absolute path to EvalSymlinks and you'll get one out. But if EvalSymlinks is passed a relative path, there is no added harm in returning one.

It's really looking to me like we should use GetFinalPathNameByHandle in EvalSymlinks. Are there other reasons we should not?
