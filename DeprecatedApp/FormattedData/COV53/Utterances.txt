# Add a “Stories” Feature to Windows Terminal
Stories are the new hotness. Snapchat invented Stories but the paradigm of ephemeral updates has since been adopted by Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and most recently, Spotify. There is even a VS Code extension that adds this feature. 

Why should LinkedIn get all the fun?! Windows Terminal might be a singular experience (but with user profiles, is it really), but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t create an ephemeral social layer into it. 

Windows Terminal “Stories” could be in gist form (a la GitHub) or scripts in your favorite shell language (PWSH or BASH or ZSH, in da clurb we all fam), they could also be print screens of your current terminal session. Because who doesn’t want to show off their latest Neofetch/winfetch ASCII art! 

As a longterm goal, there could even be a way to share a gist/link to your config file to share your specific terminal preferences and font/color information. 

# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
In order to see Stories from others (assuming we don’t want to focus just on local users), we would need to run some sort of web server that ties into some type of social network for followers/displays. GitHub would probably be ideal for that. 

Having said all this, as good of a feature as I believe Stories would be, it would probably require a lot of resources and overhead, not to mention possible performance concerns. Perhaps this is a better request for Hyper, since it is Electron and basically running a web browser anyway. (No shade to Hyper — Hyper is great and beautiful and I’m just teasing out of love!)

In fact, the more I write about this. Maybe it’s a bad idea.

I know that this is [90% a meme post from twitter](https://twitter.com/cinnamon_msft/status/1333341760848740352), but this is also our actual work tracker, so I've gotta be at least 5% serious here:

I don't believe the Terminal is the place to implement most of this. 
* We've already got a commandline ecosystem problem of users just executing random scripts that they download with `curl` - if we're letting users install scripts that they saw on someone's story, then i can guarantee you there'll be scripts like "Run Graphical Applications in WSL!!!" that actually just `rm -rf /mnt/c`. I don't want to be held responsible for contributing to that problem.
* I think GitHub gists are already better suited for a lot of this - they've already got syntax highlighting for different languages, they've already got accounts set up, and authentication, and hey, they've already got a web-scale website that can host all this, and frankly I'm not prepared, nor is anyone on the team, to build that ourselves.
* We've also already got #469 on the backlog for recording Terminal output to the asciinema format, for sharing on https://asciinema.org. Again, that's another site that's probably better suited for hosting recordings of terminal sessions, rather than us standing this up on our own. 

So those are reasons why _I_ would reject this feature request. However, this thread is definitely @cinnamon-msft's responsibility, so I'll let them handle it.
