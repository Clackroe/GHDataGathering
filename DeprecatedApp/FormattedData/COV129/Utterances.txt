COM0 +++$+++ SP7413755 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ 2018-03-30T11:41:01Z +++$+++ It's caused by `conhost.exe` excessively hammering the registry to query the following two values:

    HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ImmersiveShell\TabletMode
    HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\DWM\ColorPrevalence

Having previously reported this issue through Feedback Hub (to no avail), let me offer my observations from debugging this issue:

 - It's not specific to Dell's XPS series - I've been able to reproduce on any Windows 10 installation from version 1703 and up
 - It only occurs when the console application writes output that causes the console to *scroll*
 - It only occurs when the console application in question is in foreground/focus
 - Each reg value mentioned above is queried 6 times, per scroll!!!

An easy way of show the resulting difference in speed is to compare to anything piped to `Out-String`:

    $WindowHeight = $Host.UI.RawUI.WindowSize.Height
    Clear-Host
    $StopWatch = [Diagnostics.Stopwatch]::StartNew()
    &{
        1..($WindowHeight * 2)|ForEach-Object{
            Write-Output "test"
        }
    }
    $MultiString = $StopWatch.Elapsed
    Clear-Host
    $StopWatch = [Diagnostics.Stopwatch]::StartNew()
    &{
        1..($WindowHeight * 2)|ForEach-Object{
            Write-Output "test"
        }
    } | Out-String
    $SingleString = $StopWatch.Elapsed

Even though we add overhead from `Out-String`, and the number of lines that the console host eventually need to write to the screen buffer are exactly the same, you'll find that the `$MultiString` measurement is significantly larger that `$SingleString`, presumably because the former caused the console host to scroll `$WindowsHeight` where as the latter only had to cause a single scroll. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

1. What DPI scaling factor are you using?
1. What is the font face & size of your affected Console(s)?

> FWIW, I used my [timing script](https://github.com/bitcrazed/PowerRazzle/blob/master/TimedRun.cmd) to measure the elapsed time to execute and render the recursive listing command above.

With the font set at 36pt, there is indeed a marked slow-down, but remember:
1. Console currently uses GDI to draw text which uses your CPU to render text glyphs
1. GDI generates and caches glyphs, and then BLITs them onto the screen
1. The larger the glyph, the fewer can be cached
1. At 18pt, the client area is 1053x675. At 36pt, the client area is 2025x1350 and the resulting glyphs are 4x bigger ... that's a lot of LARGE bitmaps to BLIT
1. And since scrolling often results in significant text changes between iterations of the render loop, the entire client area can end up being "dirtied", resulting in the full Console client area having to be fully re-rendered each time! 2025x1350 x 4bytes each pixel == 10MB per frame x 60 fps == 656MB/s we have to force from your CPU to the GPU's frame buffer every second!. 

That's a lot of data by anyone's measure, and it makes one's machine do a lot of work:

![recursive-dir](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/961950/44121072-5daffba8-9fd3-11e8-9831-49e00faa5233.png)

Now, can we go faster? HELLS YEAH! ðŸ˜œ

The GDI team recently improved their glyph caching mechanism, with more improvements planned for future releases, but increased the Glyph Cache buffer to mitigate the above factors until those improvements can be made.

Also, Console plans on replacing our GDI renderer to DirectWrite at some point in the future which should eliminate this issue anyhow. 

_Also_ we have some other tricks up our sleeves that we hope will noticeably improve text rendering perf, esp. while scrolling. Bear with us ;)

I'll leave this issue open for now, and we'll update it when we have any solid perf improvements to share. +++$+++ 1 +++$+++ 0

COM29 +++$+++ SP16415478 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM28 +++$+++ 2018-11-09T10:23:25Z +++$+++ Hello, I would like to point out that poor console performance in Windows 10 is still present in 1809.

Resolution is 1920x1080, scaling is 100%, console font size is 16pt Consolas.

In my case, running IDA Pro interactive disassembler (idaw.exe) in the console results in a totally absurd situation where conhost.exe is using more CPU than the program itself:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16415478/48256712-bb6ea380-e410-11e8-99b6-26c2fd7bd8ce.png)

Looking at the threads of conhost.exe the culprits are obvious:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16415478/48256869-3041dd80-e411-11e8-831d-e56a73bcd0a7.png)

The only part of the console window being updated is highlighted:

Why is drawing 8 characters at a fixed position using 10% of the 3.2 GHz quad-core CPU, and what is more important, why is this slowing down the console program so much that something which took minutes in Windows XP takes hours in Windows 10?

People were drawing full screen graphics on 1 MHz Motorola 6502 CPU 3 decades ago without dedicated graphics hardware, this is how far modern programmers have fallen. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
