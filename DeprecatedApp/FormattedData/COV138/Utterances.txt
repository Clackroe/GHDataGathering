 - Feature Idea

##### COMPONENT NAME
import_playbook

##### ANSIBLE VERSION
<!--- Paste verbatim output from "ansible --version" between quotes below -->
```
2.4.0.0
```

##### CONFIGURATION
<!---
If using Ansible 2.4 or above, paste the results of "ansible-config dump --only-changed"
Otherwise, mention any settings you have changed/added/removed in ansible.cfg
(or using the ANSIBLE_* environment variables).
-->

n/a

##### OS / ENVIRONMENT

CentOS 6

##### SUMMARY

I need to conditionally import a playbook, which isn't possible.  The keyword I'm missing is "include_playbook" which would allow a "when" to apply to it.  Why?

I have a playbook that performs some maintenance, OS, Kernel, package, and firmware upgrades.  For Major upgrades, we track progress in a ticketing system.  So, during those runs, I'd like to conditionally import a playbook that updates the ticket information.  In order for that to work, I need to pass the user's password to the ticketing system, so there's a `vars_prompt` in the ticket update playbook.  If the user specifies which ticket they're working to the maintenance playbook, I'd like the ticket update playbook to be called after the maintenance is performed.

If there's another way for this to work, I'm open to alternate ideas, but I think conditionally playbook imports would be generically useful.  I'm not understanding why tasks could be included dynamically, but a playbook wouldn't be.

##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
<!---
For bugs, show exactly how to reproduce the problem, using a minimal test-case.
For new features, show how the feature would be used.
-->

<!--- Paste example playbooks or commands between quotes below -->
```yaml
# Maintenance Play Runs first, then conditionally import a second playbook
- import_playbook: update-ticket.yaml
  when: ticket_id is defined
```

<!--- You can also paste gist.github.com links for larger files -->

##### EXPECTED RESULTS
<!--- What did you expect to happen when running the steps above? -->

I expect `update-ticket.yaml` to only import if the `ticket_id` is defined.

##### ACTUAL RESULTS
<!--- What actually happened? If possible run with extra verbosity (-vvvv) -->

no parse error, and playbook `update-ticket.yaml` is imported 100% of the time.

COM1 +++$+++ SP171090 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM0 +++$+++ 2018-01-29T15:17:35Z +++$+++ We have similar need. We have a main playbook that prepares the system, but we allow the user to provide some extra steps by creating a playbook files in a well known directories. We do not know what files will be present there in advance. For this we would really like to have include_playbook that supports with_fileglob (or with_items). +++$+++ 4 +++$+++ 0
COM2 +++$+++ SP171090 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM1 +++$+++ 2018-01-29T15:21:43Z +++$+++ Just to explain why include_tasks is not enough. The system is clustered and the tasks talk to localhost, other physical hosts and virtual machines. We could in theory use delegate_to if it supported host groups. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM3 +++$+++ SP341037 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM2 +++$+++ 2018-03-22T02:21:37Z +++$+++ I also have this need in order to import different playbooks to configure Vagrant guests differently depending on the active hypervisor.

Alternate to `when` is something like (this is also not supported):
```YAML
- import_playbook: "install_{{ 'virtualbox' if ansible_product_name == 'VirtualBox' else 'vmware' if ansible_product_name = 'VMware Virtual Platform' else 'noop' }}_extensions.yml"

COM4 +++$+++ SP102495 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM3 +++$+++ 2018-04-23T09:27:31Z +++$+++ Is this going to be fixed soon? I find it as a serious source of problems because the optional playbook code ca be huge when it comes to number of tasks, causing over **extensive console/log verbosity** of tasks that are never supposed to be loaded.

The `skip_reason": "Conditional result was False"` is not of much help either because the user will not see any condition on those tasks, the condition being few nested includes/imports away in another file.

It helps nobody that Ansible will list hundreds of lines of files that were never supposed to be run, making much harder to investigate them. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM5 +++$+++ SP22767209 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM4 +++$+++ 2018-05-05T20:55:47Z +++$+++ As a workaround until this is possible, if the use case is to support different host groups it is possible to use an include_task with a conditional on group names, i.e. a task include for a group `foo` is included when a file `tasks_directory/foo.yml` is provided:

```
- include_tasks: "{{item}}"
  with_fileglob: "tasks_directory/*.yml"
  vars:
    file_host_group: "{{ (item | basename | splitext)[0]}}"
  when: "file_host_group in group_names"
```

The playbook including this construct has to run for all hosts.

I'm kind of implementing something like an `ansible-galaxy` style method of "installing" playbooks into a playbooks sub-directory and then I want to `include_playbook` a playbook that was just "installed".  

Here is what I've got so far:

```yaml
- name: PLAY | Install other required playbooks
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  tasks:

    - name: INCLUDE_VARS | include variables to discover other needed playbooks
      include_vars:
        dir: playbooks/
        files_matching: requirements.yml
        depth: 1

    - name: GIT | Clone playbooks
      git:
        repo: "{{ item.src }}"
        dest: "playbooks/{{ item.src.split('/')[-1] }}"
        version: "{{ item.version }}"
      loop: "{{ elk_required_playbooks }}"

    - name: SHELL | Install included playbooks roles
      shell: ansible-galaxy install -r roles/requirements.yml -p roles/
      args:
        chdir: "playbooks/{{ item.src.split('/')[-1] }}"
      loop: "{{ elk_required_playbooks }}"

- name: PLAY | Run the installed helloWorld playbook
  import_playbook: "playbooks/ap_hello_world/helloWorld.yml"
```
If I run this as-is, I get an import error because the playbook to be imported isn't there yet.

```bash
ERROR! Unable to retrieve file contents
Could not find or access '/path/to/playbooks/ap_hello_world/helloWorld.yml'
```
If I comment out the `import_playbook` play, the functionality above that works nearly like `ansible-galaxy` and "installs" the playbooks I need (and the roles they need).

I suppose this could be split up into two (2) separate playbooks in the same Git repo.  The first would be called `prepare.yml` or maybe `prerequisites.yml` to "install" the other needed playbooks and the second main playbook (`playbook.yml`) will do the necessary imports, etc.  I was really wanting to make this a "one-shot" playbook. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0

COM27 +++$+++ SP45837141 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM26 +++$+++ 2019-05-23T17:30:07Z +++$+++ I'm trying to do what [watsonb](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/34281#issuecomment-417762220) was, using ansible-galaxy to install roles, and then using the roles. 

I found a decent workaround for the all-in-one playbook, which was to place the playbooks, in the order that you want them to execute, on the command line. In Watsonb's case, that would look like

ansible-playbook ... prepare.yml playbook.yml

Any variables that you set on the command line are passed to the playbooks, sequentially.

This might also solve [MarSik's](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/34281#issuecomment-361277446) problem, also, using file globbing on the command line instead of in the playbook. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM28 +++$+++ SP171090 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM27 +++$+++ 2019-05-23T18:47:20Z +++$+++ @decet It could, but that would basically mean using a top level bash script as the entrypoint and spliting the main ansible playbook into multiple stage files. Not too horrible, just ugly. +++$+++ 0 +++$+++ 0
COM29 +++$+++ SP1863643 +++$+++ ROOT +++$+++ COM28 +++$+++ 2019-05-24T00:37:55Z +++$+++ I've overcome this in my own way as follows.  First, my typical playbook directory structure:

```bash
.
├── .ansible-lint
├── .gitignore
├── .yamllint
├── ansible.cfg
├── callback_plugins
│   ├── junit.py
│   ├── log_plays.py
│   ├── profile_roles.py
│   ├── profile_tasks.py
│   ├── timer.py
├── check_ansible_lint.sh
├── check_syntax.sh
├── check_yaml_lint.sh
├── create.yml
├── destroy.yml
├── Jenkinsfile
├── localhost_inventory.yml
├── playbooks
│   ├── ap_linux_instance
│   └── requirements.yml
├── prerequisites.yml
├── README.md
├── reports
├── requirements.txt
├── roles
│   ├── ar_linux_ansible_venv
│   ├── ar_linux_cname
│   ├── config_encoder_filters
│   └── requirements.yml
└── VERSION.md
```

My .gitignore ignores most sane OS/language/IDE things, but also ignores everything in the `roles/` and `playbooks/` folders except for the `requirements.yml` files in each folder.  The requirements.yml file within the playbooks folder is similar to your Galaxy-style requirements.yml, but rather than calling out dependent playbooks by Galaxy owner.name, I specify the full Git source (Galaxy supports this of course).  The requirements.yml within the roles/ folder is just your traditional Galaxy-style requirements.

I have this `prerequisites.yml` playbook, that looks like this:

```yaml
---

- name: PLAY | Install other required playbooks
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  tasks:

    - name: INCLUDE_VARS | include variables to discover other needed playbooks
      include_vars:
        dir: playbooks/
        files_matching: requirements.yml
        depth: 1

    - name: GIT | Clone playbooks
      git:
        repo: "{{ item.src }}"
        dest: "playbooks/{{ item.src.split('/')[-1] }}"
        version: "{{ item.version }}"
      loop: "{{ required_playbooks }}"

    - name: SHELL | Install included playbooks roles
      shell: ansible-galaxy install -r roles/requirements.yml -p roles/ --force
      args:
        chdir: "playbooks/{{ item.src.split('/')[-1] }}"
      loop: "{{ required_playbooks }}"
      when: item.galaxy
      changed_when: false
      tags: [ skip_ansible_lint ]
```
And, assuming that my "big bang" create.yml depends on a playbook and its roles from another playbook project, I import it like this:

```yaml
# ~~~~~~~~~~
# Ensure that all of the host VMs in the inventory are up and running
# either on-prem or in Azure as specified in the inventory
#
- name: Ensure inventory hosts are present
  import_playbook: "playbooks/ap_linux_instance/create.yml"
  tags: [ base_server, hosts ]
```

And so, the work-flow to run my "big bang" (e.g. create.yml) is a 3-liner:

```bash
ansible-playbook prerequisites.yml
ansible-galaxy install -r roles/requirements -p roles/
ansible-playbook create.yml -i <path_to_inventory>
```

You could, of course, wrap the above 3-liner in a `create.sh` shell script for convenience.  This method has served me well for some fairly complex playbook projects that depend on other playbook projects.  This forces us to keep roles and playbooks fairly self-contained and re-usable and factor variables out into their own inventory projects.  When performed with discipline, it makes it really easy to migrate unaltered roles/playbooks to other environments, then just update inventory variables that are unique to that environment.

**This doesn't solve the conditional import problem**, mind you, but does help me use the `import_playbook` statement for something that may not exist just yet.  It kind of gets around a conditional in my very specific use-case.  I make use of tagging on the `import_playbook` to leverage the command-line `--tags` and `--skip-tags` features if I need scalpel-like precision at run-time. But if you had to make an import decision based on some other conditional logic (e.g., OS family), well, we still need that as a language feature I think.  For now, I just handle those cases with sub-playbooks and chain them together ensuring I target the appropriate hosts/groups that should or should not be targeted based on how I've setup my inventory (yes, it can get messy).

This is all pretty wild and requires a high degree if what I commonly refer to as "4th dimensional thinking", especially when you consider branches/versions of things and running them from CI/CD platforms like Jenkins or even AWX.  But I still find Ansible fascinating and use it daily.
