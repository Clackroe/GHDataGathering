Steps to Reproduce:
Install latest build of insiders.

Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: No

Sorry but the guy who created https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/87268 has it all wrong. Having a santa hat on a cog icon (to go to settings/options) has nothing to do with religion in any shape or form.

I find it offensive that the hat was removed and it should never have been removed in the first place.

Pardon me but he dosn't distinguish between Saint Nicholas that was bishop and had totally diffrent hat and Santa Claus from popular culture who have other hat. Besides his name "Christian" smells like some kind of religious agitation and I think he should remove his account or be baned by highter autorities using his own argumentation preented in issue #87268 . Should I create separate issue for that? +++$+++ 36 +++$+++ 1

See this? That's how silly that was. We can't take people seriously just because they slap religion on something completely unrelated and pretend it's a serious issue.

That's offensive to **real** religious issues if anything. That's how real issues end up being taken as jokes. +++$+++ 13 +++$+++ 1

The fact that he doesn't like the hat has nothing to do with religion. I find Hissvard's comment "That's offensive to real religious issues" completely right. There are real religious issues by now, and classifying such a thing (the hat) as "offensive" should be considered shameful. +++$+++ 10 +++$+++ 1

No one know who will be targeted and his life/career be destroyed by "tolerance troops" which have nothing to do with tolerance.

We are going into very, very gloomy era. 
Chinese government (which is widely criticized by us) is doing the very same thing as "political correctness" is doing to us.

In totalitarian state, anyone who voiced a different opinion than the state's, was forcibly silenced or 'disappeared'. Now, we have threads locked, accounts banned and single people deciding what's best for entire communities based on their 'feelings'. Well, I 'feel' it's pure evil masquerading as tolerance. +++$+++ 4 +++$+++ 0

Added bonus would have been that the whole issue would be forgotten for everyone in some days. 

So, this leaves a very sour taste regarding the whole thing and it has already the very opposite intented effect of "quick political correct reaction and stay clean" for the whole Microsoft and only will be worse if this will not be corrected and sit out.

"Microsoft the Christmas Killer / Santa Killer" in the press... not a nice thought and I guess this has the potential to escalate to widely known bad press for the organisation.

My advice to the managing team here:
- don't wait it out and don't try to purge the taint when nobody's looking.
- reinstate  the santa hat, at least make it a togglable option (default: on)
- write a short paragraph that it was a mistake, include some funny joke for deescalation.
- be done with it.
