Theming is not an obvious task for a newbie like me. Also, doc speaks about gem based and 'regular' file themes. It's confusin  a bit.\r 2. At the end of demo app it's more beautiful to leave in the han of the user a well looking demo\r \r ## Idea\r \r Please include istructions on \r - how to enable default gem base theme\r - how to customized if possible a gem theme\r - how to switch to a regular file based theme\r - idem, how to customize it\r \r ... or ...\r \r Create a guide on how to start theming AND then include previous steps into the new tutorial.\r \r Thanks for this excellent piece of software !!!!", "meta": {"posReactions": "0", "negReactions": "0"}}
