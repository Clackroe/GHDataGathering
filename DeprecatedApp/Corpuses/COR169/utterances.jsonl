Yes, you are correct.\r\n\r\n#### TL;DR:\r\n\r\nThis is a known issue, and the dev team is working on it.\r\n\r\n#### Details:\r\n\r\nWe recently moved over our servers to a different infrastructure with the new platform roll out earlier last week. As a consequence, your IP addresses are masked by our CDN servers from the forum.\r\n\r\nDuring peak usage, this means the forum sees this as too many sign in requests from the same IPs which belong to our CDN servers. \r\n\r\nThis is a false positive.\r\n\r\nAs of now this stands as a known issue, we are working with various teams to get this fixed.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your patience.", "meta": {"posReactions": "0", "negReactions": "0"}}
