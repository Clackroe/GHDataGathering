This does not follow the other package managers and becomes unintuitive when dealing with multiple Linux distros. \r \r This behavior is documented. However, It doesn't follow the standard that other pkg modules use for full os upgrade.\r \r ### Setup\r run `pkg.install vim refresh=true` \r want vim, get os upgrade.", "meta": {"posReactions": "0", "negReactions": "0"}}
