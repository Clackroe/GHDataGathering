Does it keep users motivated? Yes - The #100DaysOfCode challenge is one of those initiatives. \r\n\r\nI am 100% in agreement with you that we can never design a program that will give exact report of where a learner stands in terms of knowledge gained. An 80% completion does not mean a user has 80% mastery on the topic. \r\n\r\n@jknapp25 @jeremylt \r\n\r\nLet's keep this thread constructive towards an actual implementation.

We have spent a lot of time going back-and-forth between ideas. One of the main discussions occurred here: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/39265\r\n\r\nUltimately, the decision was:\r\n> It looks cool, but there are a few things that prevent visual representation from working well here:\r\n\r\n>For each certification, the lessons only constitute about 16% of the cert. The other 84% is the certification projects. This means that on the first certification, a camper could make it through a hundred or more lessons and only be 5 or 6% of the way done with the certification. So all they would see would be a tiny slice of the pie for their first 50 hours of coding.\r\n\r\n>This is why I recommended using the (300 hours - 1.03% complete) text. Because we really need that level of granularity in the numbers. Otherwise progress would be virtually invisible from one coding session to the next.\r\n\r\n>Also, people may wonder \"what is this thing over on the right hand margin\"? The \"X.XX% complete\" text is unambiguous.\r\n\r\n>Thus, if you want to implement a text-based version of this, we would be very interested in this.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo, there is still scope to implement such a feature, but keeping in mind the discussion had in this issue, and the linked PR.\r\n\r\nWe welcome PoCs (proof of concepts) - as you have done, or more; visual communication is appreciated.
