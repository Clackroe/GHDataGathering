Git produces some paths as absolute and some paths as relative, and uses GetFinalPathNameByHandle for canonicalizing absolute paths.  However, Go lacks a function to canonicalize paths in a standard way, so it isn't possible to produce results equivalent to a C program and still write code that works portably across systems.\r \r Go should add a function that is explicitly defined to canonicalize paths in a way equivalent to the underlying operating system, since using filepath.Abs and filepath.EvalSymlinks doesn't work correctly on Windows.  It does work fine on Unix, but Unix paths are much simpler and easier to reason about.\r \r It was determined in #17084 that filepath.Abs and filepath.EvalSymlinks were sufficient in this case, but that doesn't appear to be true.  I expect there are other cases in which those don't work on Windows, but I am insufficiently versed in Windows paths to know what those are.\r \r This was originally reported to the Git LFS project in git-lfs/git-lfs#4012.", "meta": {"posReactions": "0", "negReactions": "0"}}
