It reminded me of when my parents were still alive, and brought me such indescribeable joy to see it while coding. When I updated my VSCode, it was gone. I have to assume this was a bug. Where did it go? The last thread I made on this topic was locked by accident. I posted it on my tumblr and sent it to several news outlets but it was locked, and so unusable, so I made a new one to hopefully get some resolution to this issue. This time I'll be taking screenshots to ensure that the Github Issue record doesn't become unuseable.\r \r VS Code version: Code 1.41.0 (9579eda04fdb3a9bba2750f15193e5fafe16b959, 2019-12-11T18:37:42.077Z)\r OS version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.17134\r \r <details>\r <summary>System Info</summary>\r \r |Item|Value|\r |---|---|\r |CPUs|AMD Ryzen 3 1300X Quad-Core Processor           (4 x 3793)|\r |GPU Status|2d_canvas: enabled<br>flash_3d: enabled<br>flash_stage3d: enabled<br>flash_stage3d_baseline: enabled<br>gpu_compositing: enabled<br>metal: disabled_off<br>multiple_raster_threads: enabled_on<br>oop_rasterization: disabled_off<br>protected_video_decode: unavailable_off<br>rasterization: enabled<br>skia_renderer: disabled_off<br>surface_control: disabled_off<br>surface_synchronization: enabled_on<br>video_decode: enabled<br>viz_display_compositor: enabled_on<br>viz_hit_test_surface_layer: disabled_off<br>webgl: enabled<br>webgl2: enabled|\r |Load (avg)|undefined|\r |Memory (System)|7.94GB (3.46GB free)|\r |Process Argv||\r |Screen Reader|no|\r |VM|0%|\r </details><details><summary>Extensions (1)</summary>\r \r Extension|Author (truncated)|Version\r ---|---|---\r csharp|ms-|1.21.9\r \r \r </details>\r <!-- generated by issue reporter -->", "meta": {"posReactions": "31", "negReactions": "1"}}
