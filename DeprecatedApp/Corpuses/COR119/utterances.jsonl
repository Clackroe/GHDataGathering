Thank you for your contribution!\n\nNext steps:\nA maintainer will review your change and provide feedback. See\nhttps://golang.org/doc/contribute.html#review for more info and tips to get your\npatch through code review.\n\nMost changes in the Go project go through a few rounds of revision. This can be\nsurprising to people new to the project. The careful, iterative review process\nis our way of helping mentor contributors and ensuring that their contributions\nhave a lasting impact.\n\nDuring May-July and Nov-Jan the Go project is in a code freeze, during which\nlittle code gets reviewed or merged. If a reviewer responds with a comment like\nR=go1.11 or adds a tag like \"wait-release\", it means that this CL will be\nreviewed as part of the next development cycle.
