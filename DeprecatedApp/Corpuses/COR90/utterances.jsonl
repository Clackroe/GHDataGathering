I come from Norway and people who glorify snow is equivalent to the people who glorified hitler during WW2. The amount of deaths caused by winter is massive, not to mention the depression the season brings and you want to bring that into my work space as well? This is unacceptable, everytime I leave my house I see snow and I want to escape into Visual Studio Code and get some work done and what do I see? More snow... To me this is equally offensive as a swastika.\r \r This isn't just me either, think about the people who cannot even get snow, think about how you're making them feel, making them see what they cannot get, although personally I don't understand that. Snow is terrifying.\r \r Version: 1.42.0-insider (user setup)\r Commit: 26f5dfc\r Date: 2019-12-19T05:31:04.916Z\r Electron: 6.1.6\r Chrome: 76.0.3809.146\r Node.js: 12.4.0\r V8: 7.6.303.31-electron.0\r OS: Windows_NT x64 10.0.18362\r \r Steps to Reproduce:\r \r 1.
