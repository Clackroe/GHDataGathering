Collaborators on a project may get different versions when they install, and may get different sets of compiler errors. Fixing them for one developer may break things for another. Yes, projects should override the npm default, but they have to understand TypeScript's unusual versioning scheme in order to know to do so.\r\n\r\nEven worse, an upgrade to a new minor version of TypeScript may break users of a project. We don't have any indication through version numbers of which .d.ts files are compatible with which versions of TypeScript. A project that implicitly upgrades TypeScript to a breaking version due to breaks occurring at minor releases, builds, and publishes a new version with newer declaration files, will break consumers using an older version of TypeScript. Some users can't even choose their version due to the compiler being integrated into their build system / runtime (Angular, Storybook, TS-Node).\r\n\r\nBy adopting semver TypeScript would be a much better citizen in the npm ecosystem and reduce unintended breaks.", "meta": {"posReactions": "20", "negReactions": "1"}}
