Method `ngOnInit()` is not launched too, its lauched only after any interaction with a component (form input, etc.).\r \r ## Expected behavior\r Change Detection is working with asynchronous route change.\r \r ## Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions\r Sample:\r https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-tqcthi\r \r ## Environment\r Angular version: 6.0.3\r <!-- Check whether this is still an issue in the most recent Angular version -->\r \r ## Browser:\r - [*] Chrome (desktop) version LATEST\r  \r ## For Tooling issues:\r - Node version: XX  <!-- run `v8.11.1` -->\r - Platform:  Windows\r \r ## Others:\r typescript: 2.8.1\r \r ## Comments\r It's working if Observable from `this.auth.logIn()` convert to a promise, like this:\r ```typescript\r this.auth.logIn() // returns Promise\r      .then((result) => {\r                 this.router.navigateByUrl('myApp');\r             }).catch((error) => {\r                 this.router.navigateByUrl('login');\r             });\r ```\r But I don't want to use promises, I want to use the Observable!
