The only thing I observed is that you have to click a bit \"below\" the husk which is probably due to the logical layout/overlay structure.

ERCC will never be merged upstream while I remain involved with OpenRA. At this point it has nothing to do with any of the in-game aspects, it is entirely about the behaviour of the people championing it.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the competitive RA community are good people, there is a rotten core of toxic entitlement that manifests as abuse and belittlement, often focused around ERCC, and usually focused personally against me. This behaviour has forever soured ERCC, and integrating it into the upstream RA mod now would validate that behaviour as an effective strategy for influencing OpenRA's development.\r\n\r\nWhy now? Two recent incidents targeting me (from N/A in the community discord, and Longely/Widow in the competitive discord - the two main personalities behind ERCC) were incredibly offensive and belittling, and are the straw that has broken the camels back when added on top of many other generally toxic events this year. People in the competitive community were having fun meming about \"us vs the devs\" earlier this year, but at that time I was seriously considering quitting OpenRA completely due to how unhappy and embarrased the behaviour of some people in the community (and the general tolerance of that behaviour as acceptable by everybody else) was making me. Ultimately, I decided that I enjoy working on the project, and making things better for everybody else in the community. I *do not* enjoy interacting with the assholes, and intend to be increasingly blunt in dismissing their toxic behaviour. This is the first concrete action towards that.\r\n\r\nI can certainly appreciate the desire for solving directional map imbalance, to the point where I fully implemented the code for one solution (rotatable structures) and developed a working prototype for a second (allowing harvesters to dock from any direction, visually jumping docking point). I think there is scope for some ERCC alternative, but I suggest that the competitive community as a whole put some effort into solving its attitude problem before they try to revisit such ideas here.", "meta": {"posReactions": "0", "negReactions": "0"}}
