Hello!\r \r I'm using Gatsby-MDX for my posts. And I want to add Yandex RTB-code to my site. \r \r It's Google Adsense alternative from Yandex (in Russia). Here is example, how is looking Yandex RTB-code:\r \r ```\r <div id=\"rtb-1\"></div>\r <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r     (function (w, d, n, s, t) {\r         function renderRtb () {\r             Ya.Context.AdvManager.render({\r                 blockId: \"R-A-12345-1\",\r                 renderTo: \"rtb-1\",\r                 statId: 34567, // CROSS SECTION ID\r                 async: true\r             });\r         }\r         w[n] = w[n] || [];\r         w[n].push(renderRtb);\r         t = d.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];\r         s = d.createElement(\"script\");\r         s.type = \"text/javascript\";\r         s.src = \"http://an.yandex.ru/system/context.js\";\r         s.async = true;\r         t.parentNode.insertBefore(s, t);\r     })(this, this.document, \"yandexContextAsyncCallbacks\");\r </script>\r ```\r \r Please, sir, tell me. What's there is best way to insert Yandex Ads into my MDX-posts? For example, can I create .txt-file. Then import .txt file (with Ads code) where I need into my MDX-posts?", "meta": {"posReactions": "0", "negReactions": "0"}}
