Your assumption about that it's self-descriptiveness is only _partially_ correct when you refer to several ppl you mentioned. Still, there are lots of other people who won't understand it. I myself try avoiding to assume that other people see and understand things exactly the same way as me, because every individual has their own unique experience. That said I encourage you to not make such assumptions here.\r\nI'm locking this issue, since I don't see what can be done here to turn it into an effective conversation.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to contribute into the issue resolution, I encourage you to file another issue with clear description of the problem.
