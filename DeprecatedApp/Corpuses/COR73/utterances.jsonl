Even with Flow, it's sometimes tricky to truly enforce component signatures, e.g. when using poorly typed HOCs.\r\n\r\nIt's true that shallow rendering won't expose problems like passing invalid props but static typing *can* solve this when done correctly.\r\n\r\n> The main value proposition of shallow rendering is that you mock out the inner components.

To me, it seems way more flexible to rely on shallow rendering for this because the test doesn't have to *know* which dependencies to mock. This is important for refactoring; a test should not break when you add/remove nested components since they are not relevant to the main component under test -- nested components already have their own responsibilities.\r\n\r\nI also like how shallow rendering encourages the test author to *only* consider functionality that the component under test is responsible for.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Since we don't use the shallow renderer much anymore, we don't feel like we would be good stewards of its API, or even can recommend it. \r\n\r\nThat makes sense, I was just curious to understand why, in case I'm missing some flaws in shallow rendering.\r\n", "meta": {"posReactions": "14", "negReactions": "0"}}
