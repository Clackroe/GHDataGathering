At that time, a bug had caused account duplications for some users. \r\n\r\nWith the recent Oct, 2019 update to the platform, we have identified that the bug was fixed but the account duplications remain in the database. These unfortunately have to fixed by our team manually. Users have progressed with the curriculum since last year and a programmatic fix may not be possible.\r\n\r\nNone of your progress is gone or lost. They are simply lying in a different account with the same email address or username attached to it.\r\n\r\n**Does this affect how I login? Can I use GitHub or other logins**\r\n\r\nWe simply rely on the email address that is received by us, as long as GitHub, Facebook, Google are returning the same email you have with us you will be signed into your correct account.\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience, and understanding with this. The newer platform is more resilient and we look forward to your feedback \r\n\r\n", "meta": {"posReactions": "0", "negReactions": "0"}}
