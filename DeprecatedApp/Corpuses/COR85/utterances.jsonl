Things done in WSL do not affect the outcome. This extension does not use WSL under the hood even if you have your terminal configured to use WSL. You must have it setup through the means the Windows OS uses._\r\n1. Follow directions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting#_setting-up-the-ssh-agent) to enable the Windows SSH-Agent.  This addresses the errors with the ` \\\\.\\pipe\\openssh-ssh-agent` in the message.\r\n2. Ensure that you have your SSH keys inside of `<windows user folder>/.ssh/`. \r\n3. Run `ssh-add` from powershell. This was the last part that I was missing and why I would get `All configured authentication methods failed`\r\n\r\nIn the end, would be nice if these errors were caught and the users were notified of the GUI of what actions might be needed.\r\n", "meta": {"posReactions": "5", "negReactions": "0"}}

There's nothing we can realistically do about the fact that our dependencies (`dockerode`, `ssh2` Node packages) require an auth agent, at least not in the short term, but we can warn the user if they have an SSH DOCKER_HOST but no agent set up.
