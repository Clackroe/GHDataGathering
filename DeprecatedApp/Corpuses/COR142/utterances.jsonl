However, the challenge is about \"chaining\" multiple functions together.  It is super unclear how the example code would lead one to chaining a filter and map function together.  This is really a better discussion for the functional programming section.\r \r Additionally, the filter function requires that users understand how to determine if a number is an integer or not.  There is nothing in the prior curriculum which would make it clear to a new coder how to do this.  While you do talk about the \"parseInt\" function, it's never used in the context of comparing a number to itself.  A better filter function might be \"positive numbers\" instead, which is a much simpler comparison.\r \r I was attempting to help someone understand this one today and I was initially flummoxed as to how to solve it.\r \r Once I realized it was about chaining, I was able to write a solution like this:\r ```js\r const squaredIntegers = arr\r     .filter(elem => elem == parseInt(elem))\r     .map(elem => elem * elem);\r ```\r \r I don't believe that there is another way to solve this using higher order functions and arrow functions.  There is no solution in the seed file, so I'm not sure exactly what the authors had in mind.\r \r In short, this challenge badly needs clarification and simplification.  It may be entirely inappropriate for this section of challenges.  I could see it after a new challenge called \"How to Chain Higher Order functions\" or something like that.\r \r #### Add a Link to the page with the problem\r https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/write-higher-order-arrow-functions/\r ", "meta": {"posReactions": "14", "negReactions": "0"}}
