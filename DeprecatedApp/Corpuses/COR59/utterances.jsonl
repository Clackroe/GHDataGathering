Summer is coming, and so is the implementation period for Jekyll 4.0. That's right, it's time to get some breaking changes in.

We're all volunteers here, keep that in mind.\r \r Feel free to revive old feature requests, too, just not something that we've explicitly rejected.\r \r For an organized view of how we're consolidating ideas and features, check out our Project board: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/projects/2", "meta": {"posReactions": "0", "negReactions": "0"}}
