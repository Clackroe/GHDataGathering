An example of this can be viewed here: https://codepen.io/MartijnCuppens/pen/PEgNVM?editors=1100 The class can also be added to the `html` or the `body` to disable responsive font sizes on the whole page. Downside of this implementation is that more css is generated (that's why I needed to increase the `maxSize` in `package.json`) and it increases specificity.\r\n\r\nAnother approach is to use `$rfs-class: false;`. This is the most performant solution but the `.disable-responsive-font-size` class cannot be added to elements. It can of course still be changed in scss, but I can imagine some people load the Bootstrap css via a CDN may prefer their font-size doesn't change. A possible solution for this is to generate 2 css versions: one with and one without responsive font-sizes.\r\n\r\n", "meta": {"posReactions": "0", "negReactions": "0"}}
