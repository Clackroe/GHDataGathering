This patch wires up Metal Binary Archives for Mac and iOS. Metal Binary Archives\r are used to cache pipeline state objects generated at runtime on the device and\r serialize them to disk when rendering is paused. In this prototype, the binary\r archives are serialized to disk when the application moves into the background.\r On the next launch of the application, the serialized representation of the\r archives is used for the creation of new pipeline state objects.\r \r Per the [details in the linked issue][1], I do not recommend we land this patch.\r This PR is just meant to be a record of the prototyping work done to evaluate\r Metal Binary Archives for Flutter.\r \r [1]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/60267#issuecomment-762786388\r \r ## Observations\r \r Once patched in, the following observations can be made while running a Flutter application.\r \r * After first launch, the application caches directory should contain a `.metallib` file with the following format. `flutter_engine_<engine_version>_<skia_version>_<index>.metallib`. This was done so any changes to the Flutter engine or the Skia version would not run the risk of using invalid cached contents. The file ([example](https://github.com/flutter/engine/files/5865817/flutter_engine_08daa2c8962687253fbcbd812d08d70c34c86721_069e484cc3b9518f115312c065a6f9c843b0839a_0.metallib.zip)) seems to be a Mach-O binary. This is consistent with Apple's recommendation that the `lipo` tool be used to combine archives harvested from devices of different GPU families.\r * This file will get updated every time the application is backgrounded and will get reused when the application is launched.\r * To prevent any issues with threading (I could find no mention in the docs about the thread safety aspects of any of the APIs) only raster thread operations will using this archive.\r * One open question not answered in my linked comment was how much these archives would help for jank during subsequent application launches (as seeding the archive for first launch is a no-go). I tried to find determine this by making sure the cache was seeded and launching the application again. My hope was to see a reduction in the `GrMtlPipelineStateBuilder::finalize` trace in Observatory. This [did not materialize (trace is from a warmed up archive)](https://github.com/flutter/engine/files/5865862/warmed_cached_pipeline_state_extra_skia_traces.json.zip). This seems to be because the primary cause of jank in pipeline state setup is the construction of the Metal shader library (SKSL -> MSL -> MTLLibrary (AIR?)) and not the pipeline state object construction. An annotated version of one of the traces is as follows:\r ![Screen Shot 2021-01-25 at 2 24 51 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44085/105694897-5058fc80-5eb6-11eb-8440-5b6f973abe0a.png)", "meta": {"posReactions": "2", "negReactions": "0"}}

In theory, one could try to write a lot of that logic itself as a shader program, compile that \"uber shader\" once, and then never suffer from shader compilation jank during application run. In practice, that's extremely difficult to do correctly and may not even be possible to do performantly - shaders want to be small, well defined programs typically, and supporting everything that Flutter can do with such a program (on all the GPUs we have to support) is a very large problem space. Caching smaller programs can help, but it is not an ideal solution since different GPU/OS/driver versions can cause cache misses. This could be a problem even on iOS, where different phone/iPad models and iOS versions are in use. There are other design possibilities being considered as well.\r\n\r\nAs I said, we're working to come up with an overall better solution for this, but it's not an easy problem to deal with.
