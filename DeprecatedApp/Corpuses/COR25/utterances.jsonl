I could understand if types passed by value were written with a small letter, and types passed by reference with a capital letter. Or built-in types with small, and classes with capital.

It's just a little annoying that people think in such fictitious categories as \u201cprimitive\u201d types.

And since GDScript does not exist outside of Godot\u2014and never will\u2014implementation details are important, since _GDScript __is__ its implementation, nothing more_.  There is nothing outside of the implementation that dictates what GDScript is supposed to be, or how it is supposed to work (the docs are only meant to describe what it is).

True, there's no reason GDScript _has_ to use \"`int`\" instead of \"`Int`\", but changing it will break every current Godot coder's code and intuition with no real benefit.  One reason it may have ended up this way is that it mirrors the names of those things in C++ (what the engine devs are seeing all day), where all the types added by the engine are PascalCase, and primitive types are all lowercase.  Since the C++ functions GDScript interacts with all use the C++ built-in `bool`, `int` and `float` types, and Godot's own `Vector2`, `Variant`, `Array`, etc. types, the current situation makes GDScript code nicely mirror the same code in C++.  This isn't very useful to those who only use GDScript, but is nice for anyone also using other languages with Godot.  So I'll have to disagree with your that \"it would be nice\" to change it.\r\n\r\nIn general, I'd say the engine's syntax highlighting (and, relatedly, which things in GDScript are reserved words) is a little strange in `3.x` (why are built-in functions like `print` and `floor` reserved?), but I just did some testing, and it seems `master` doesn't really have globally reserved words (probably because of the parser rewrite).
