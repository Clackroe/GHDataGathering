Adding frames horizontally however, breaks the animations, because frame: count the cells in the spritesheet from left to right and keyframes don't update their \"frame:\" value to added cells in every row.\r \r My current workaround involves numbering each frame in the spritesheet with current and previous keyframe numbers in an external graphics editor, then go to every Animation and every track and every keyframe and manually set the new value. I hope you can see how crazy this is and becomes even more so the more animations/tracks/keyframes you have. In addition to the stupidity of the task, it's super easy to incorporate mistakes in the procedure, and hence demands a lot of concentration. \r I do not wish this job on my fiercest enemy.\r \r **Proposed solution:**\r Update Keyframe value \"frame:\" when Hframes changed depending on what VFrame the frame: was set and how many Hframes where added. For instance:\r \r Hframes =+1:\r Keyframe in VFrame row 0: update frame: value = value \r Keyframe in VFrame row 1: update frame: value =-1\r Keyframe in VFrame row 5: update frame: value =-5\r \r Hframes =+3:\r Keyframe in VFrame row 0: update frame: value = value \r Keyframe in VFrame row 1: update frame: value =-3\r Keyframe in VFrame row 5: update frame: value =-15\r \r EDIT: \r I spend a day and a halve making another graphic in hopes newcomers to this issue can gasp it quickly:\r ![keyframes-example-explained2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43533832/46406276-875ddf80-c6fa-11e8-801e-cfc1ff81bbd3.png)\r \r \r \r \r \r ![6x2gdicon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43533832/46257896-4cb53680-c4b1-11e8-9633-a9d6b6a3d093.png)\r ![6x3gdicon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43533832/46257898-4d4dcd00-c4b1-11e8-9a08-70d3b3319dd6.png)\r \r \r **Steps to reproduce:**\r \r 1.

The upside is a MUCH better overview, which is absolute indispensable, when you are doing pixelart, get more animations and frames and lower resolution sprites.\r\nCurrently I'm working on a 2D Pixelart project (something Godot praises itself for being a great fit) which means I have tons of frames that look almost indistinguishable next to each other. On top of that, naming each frame even each animation is impossible with frames just 32 pixel or 48 pixel wide which also have to accommodate the sprite.\r\nMy current (very incomplete) player base sprite has 67 rows and 8 columns, so 535 frames. The png is 112KB in size, so I honestly don't care a bit about unused pixels on my spritesheet. Even if it would be ten times as large, the ability to find animations and frames I'm looking for outweighs the 0.01 seconds additional download time a billion to one.\r\nI know you are not doing pixelart in your game (which looks absolutely awesome btw! I've been following for a while) but in pixelart animation you select move and copy previously created frames and past them into new animations all the time. That's the core of any pixelart animation. Every single pixelpush has a huge impact to your animation. So the ability to quicky jump through your spritesheet, find what you are looking for copy and paste it to someplace else in your spritesheet or compare single pixel locations from various places in your sheet, is absolutely necessary. You also have to do this because your newly created frame must match previously created ones by the pixel.

By: Enabling simple use of individual .pngs or Spritesheets in AnimatedSprites.. and letting those be controlled through AnimationPlayer. This is not about \"enhacement\". In the current state.. it seems impossible to actually use and get anything done. When I try to change the played Animation in AnimationPlayer... the only keyframed Animations played are actually the ones selected in \"Animation\" property of the AnimatedSprite. Having different animations in AnimatedSprites. Therefore completely has no effect. I am now forced to use a separate \"AnimatedSprite\" for each kind of animation. However that leads to all animations being shown on screen at once. This cumbersome workflow can't be intended by design: Especially since both AnimatedSprites and AnimationPlayer already have separate tracks for different animation-types... built... in.", "meta": {"posReactions": "0", "negReactions": "0"}}

The indices are, by design, naturally set from left to right then from top to bottom. So yeah, if you extend the texture horizontally, the indices get offset. \r\n\r\nIt is said nowhere the indices should be kept when you change the texture size, and event if we did, people might even complain because their indices could go unordered when changing from one texture to another. It might even be compatibility breaking. So for now, by design, Godot does not support changing the size of your texture while keeping the indices. That's all.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, it is more like \"we did not think about this problem when we designed it\", but that's the  definition of an enhancement : it works as expected, we know it has limitations, but everything happening here is completely expected.\r\n\r\nBut also, I don't want to be mean but I would prefer not to have this kind of discussions.

A bug happens when a software does not behave as expected from the programmer point of view, not the user one.
