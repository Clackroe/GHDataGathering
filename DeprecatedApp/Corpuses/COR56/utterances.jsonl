I think.\r \r But for getting **raw** response as string/byte[] to extract all needed details, where should i start? I am not sure. I want to work with the response like a normal response and i want to work besides with all headers of this response to check exactly whats in - not consumed already, only **raw response string/byte[]**\r \r Can you give me the right starting points?", "meta": {"posReactions": "0", "negReactions": "0"}}
