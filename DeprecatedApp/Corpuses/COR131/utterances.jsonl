The native features of each platform and UI control are within reach in a simple, cross-platform API for you to deliver no-compromise user experiences while sharing even more code than before.\r \r There has been https://mauilinux.org/ for a long time:\r \r > Fast and easy to use, yet powerful for computer users of all levels, **Maui** is a part-rolling distribution based on KDE Neon/Ubuntu. Maui features its own managed repositories and backport channels and ships with the following software components and applications for day-to-day use\r \r According to [Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui_Linux), Maui Linux has been around sine 2016.\r \r Also, there has been [**Maui**Kit](https://mauikit.org/) for a long time:\r \r > **MauiKit**, a free and modular front-end framework for developing fast and compelling user experiences\r \r There is clearly a name clash.\r \r ### Steps to Reproduce\r \r 1.
