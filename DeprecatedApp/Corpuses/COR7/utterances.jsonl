It would be easier for us to simply say that it should be the global binary at all time and that's it - similar to how npm is distributed. But different projects value different things, and in our case we care a lot about giving each user exactly the version they expect - whether it's Yarn 1, 2, 3, or 42. We care about it so much that we introduced a builtin feature for that three years ago, that we made it the default a year ago, and that we started the discussions around Corepack three months ago.\r\n\r\nOf course it means that not all users are necessarily on the latest release. That's fine! Because they already have a tool that solves their needs right now, and because we'll never break semantics by redefining existing fields or ranges - as that would negatively affect past users by forcing them to upgrade. Now, perhaps later their use case will evolve, they'll need better perfs, or to solve a particular bug, or to implement something on their own, and they'll upgrade to the latest release, which will keep receiving regular bugfixes and new features.

Why is yarn different from those other package managers?\r\n* \"They may hit edge cases every once in a while, but the whole reason they use it is that they mostly figured out that the tradeoff was still value-positive for their current project.\" Same point as above. If they're already using it and have a workflow around that, what is the reason to add it to Node.js?\r\n* \"Being frozen is a feature, it's a gift that we are giving.\" Framing a decision you've made as a \"gift\" implies that the recipient should be grateful. If they're not, that sets them up to be the villain. Frankly, I don't really think this framing has a space in this PR nor, honestly, to our users.\r\n* \"It means that existing users won't get accidental regressions or bugs. Yarn is about stability, and putting our users in control.\" How is this different than permanently pinning to a package manager version across a company? I can use the first-ever published version of Yarn and expect the same, just like I can for npm, pnpm, Bower, or jspm.\r\n* \"You shouldn't need to upgrade just because we release something new.\" Wasn't your previous assertion that you're only going to be doing security releases from now on?\r\n\r\nI am entirely familiar with the arguments around projects being \"done\" and feature complete.

All versions of Yarn act both as a package manager and a jumper (similar, if you will, to `gulp-cli`). If it finds a `yarnPath` entry in `.yarnrc.yml`, it will use it instead of the global one. In other words, older projects will use Yarn 1 (because that's the global version used as fallback when nothing is found), or the checked-in package manager if it finds the right configuration to do so. Put simply, everyone gets what they ask for. There is no \"involuntarily upgrading users who are on an older version\".

Years ago it was Emacs v Vim, then Tabs v Space, and nowadays Yarn v npm. I feel the need to mention this, because studies have shown that those who oppose tend to be more vocal than those who support, especially when the opposition is the status quo.\r\n\r\nGiven that the primary goal (at least for me) is to help current users, not necessarily acquire new ones, I'd be wary of the survey wording. Specifically, I'd be cautious about not making it look like a \"two parties\" question. In my opinion, the survey would benefit by proving not only that a segment of the Node community would be positively impacted by this change, but also that even those who wouldn't directly benefit from it *wouldn't be negatively impacted* either.\r\n\r\nFor instance, rather than \"would you like it? Y/N/neutral\", which could incite non-Yarn users to answer N rather than neutral, perhaps a more suitable question would be \"would it benefit your workflows? Y/N; would it impede your workflows? Y/N\" (perhaps with a \"Why?\" box on each, to get testimonies on both sides). Basically focusing on the effects rather than the feelings. My 2 cents.\r\n\r\n(One last note in the meantime, @jasnell made an informal Twitter poll pretty much about this about a year ago; while the results are incomplete with only 378 answers, it can help set expectations and perhaps give ideas about wording: https://github.com/nodejs/node/discussions/15244#discussioncomment-99336)", "meta": {"posReactions": "6", "negReactions": "0"}}

Even with the RFC process, npm's roadmap is still controlled by a singular commercial interest. Perhaps the better forum for such discussions would be the OpenJS Foundation, where a spec and reference implementation for such things could live while allowing competition on specific implementations. But... that's a separate conversation.\r\n\r\n@iarna does raise a valid point about ensuring that bugs that need to be fixed in the 1.x stream are fixed in 1.x. As I understand it, there's no intent on shipping yarn2 in core which means we cannot interpret \"fixed in 2\" as being meaningful here. @arcanis addresses that concern rather well [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node/discussions/37193#discussioncomment-341216). So long as there is a demonstrated commitment to ensuring that security and critical bug fixes are made, and that yarn1 remains functional/compatible with Node.js@latest, then I'm not sure what else can be said there that would be convincing. Specifically, no one has asserted that the yarn versions shipped in node.js would be \"unupdatable\".\r\n\r\nI would not expect Node.js to just accept that unquestioningly. I would expect Node.js to hold Yarn accountable to that promise that the issues would be addressed, and if it turns out the issues are not addressed and major bugs persist, then we would always have the option of removing yarn from the distribution.\r\n\r\n@iarna also said:\r\n> ...if that lands in a way that's acceptable and adopted the major package managers still under development, it would be very uncomfortable for Node itself to be shipping with one that didn't support it.\r\n\r\nBut that's not the case here. Node.js would not just be shipping a single package manager option that did not support the feature, it would continue shipping multiple package manager options. It would be up to users to determine what they want to use -- and whether support for that new feature is important to them or not. The users would give us the necessary feedback to determine which is the right path. That said, it would be rather unfriendly to the ecosystem as a whole for a single package manager run by a singular commercial interest to unilaterally ship a new feature that would qualify as a \"must support\" by others.", "meta": {"posReactions": "3", "negReactions": "0"}}

The RFC you're talking about has received strong objections from both Yarn and pnpm - objections which from what transpire from the issue don't plan to be addressed.
