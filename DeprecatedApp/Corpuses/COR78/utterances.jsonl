For me the WCF stack is quite impressive, and support for server side WCF on .NET Core would be fantastic. Please feel free to add your opinions to the thread.  Here is a list of some of the WCF features (that comes to my mind): - Throttling - Reliability - Ordered Messages - Bindings - Instance Management - Behaviors - Transactions - Security - Discovery - Metadata Exchange - Extensibility  These features and more are for me very desirable, but some might be harder to support (e.g. WCF transactions relies on MS DTC (as fas as I know), but transactions enabled communication on a server side is a very important feature).
