Basically the issue is about the supported language list being misleading by marking Simplified Chinese as \u201c\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u4e2d\u56fd\uff09\u201d aka Chinese\uff08China\uff09,and marking Traditional Chinese as \u201c\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u53f0\u6e7e\uff09\u201d aka Chinese(Taiwan). This is technically misleading and incorrect. \r\n\r\nMore commonly we see Simplified Chinese as \u201c\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09\u201d and Traditional Chinese as \u201c\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u4f53\uff09, which is region-neutral. But if the supported language list is designed to be (language, region) pair, I think we should mark at least Taiwan as a region instead of a country.
