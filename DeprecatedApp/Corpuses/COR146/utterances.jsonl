You're not paying anything right now to begin with. The framework and platform is already free to use. And you're likely making money from it.\r\n2.

A common alternative that I know of is Keycloak (which you can easily use for your .NET apps as well).\r\n5. There are other alternatives to building your own identity provider. In Azure, you could use Azure AD. On-premise you have ADFS. And you can also use free third-party services like Auth0 or just integrate other identity providers directly.\r\n5.
