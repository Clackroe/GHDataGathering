Thank you for telling me about it, I'll look into that when I get the chance. Secondly, literally none of the hooks related to the chat system cover my mod's use case, where:\r\n* The mod does not have to be installed on the client\r\n* Users can individually choose to opt out of the chat censor using a command\r\n* The censor also censors messages sent by systems that the user can type input to, such as the names of claimed territories in Clans, Towny, Factions, etc, to help ensure there is no way around it\r\n\r\nI would not have put in the effort to make a coremod in the first place if any of the hooks were able to do this.", "meta": {"posReactions": "0", "negReactions": "0"}}
