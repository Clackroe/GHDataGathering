Google groups are literally terrible. For example, there are 0 results for \"Unable to parse /etc/ansible/hosts as an inventory source\" when searching this in the group. However, Google finds multiple hits, and among the top ranking hits are these issue threads. Github issue tracker has a far superior interface because it's easy for winning solutions to be marked with reaction emojis. When a winning solution is found, the more people that it works for, the more emojis that solution will collect. This saves people a lot of time and reading, because I can skim an issue thread for the reaction emojis, I don't need to struggle to comprehend every commenter's broken english description of something that's probably not even relevant. Please reconsider.", "meta": {"posReactions": "0", "negReactions": "0"}}
