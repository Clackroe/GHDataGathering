How should this work?\r\n\r\n> Or _fastlane_require_plugin_ could be added in order to fail if there is no entry with a provided plugin name in a project _Pluginfile_?\r\n\r\nDoesn't this already happen when you use an action of a plugin, that is not installed?\r\n\r\nThat being said: You can of course create an action in your shared `Fastfile` that does exactly what I described above. Download some file, edit `Pluginfile` (or create it if it doesn'T exist) or add it additionally to `Gemfile`, then run `bundle install` using the `sh()` action.

It would change files on the file system and also\r\n\r\nProbably that would still not work? When running fastlane command via `bundle exec` no other gem can be loaded as _bundler_ disallows loading gems that are not in the bundle. So when `import_from_git` is called in _fastlane_ runtime, _bundler_ runtime environment has already been created and won't allow any other gems to be loaded.\r\n\r\nHowever, the only solution that comes to my mind, to make it work with _bundler_, would be to nest another call to `bundle exec` but with a temporary _Gemfile_ (it can be passed like that: `BUNDLE_GEMFILE=PATH_TO_TEMP/Gemfile bundle exec some_command`). This temporary _Gemfile_ would include all the entries from a _project_ _Gemfile_/_Pluginfile_ and all the entries from an _imported_ _Gemfile_/_Pluginfile_ (as _Gemfile_ is actually calling `eval_gemfile` on a _Pluginfile_ so it is like those entries would be in a _Gemfile_). No modification of a current _Gemfile_ or any other file is needed.\r\n\r\nBut this is  **not a good** idea ;), and it would only work if `import_from_git` was at the beginning of a _Fastfile_ - it would be the most convenient to just call `bundle_exec` with the same command and parameters as the original one.\r\nOne caveat of it is that it nests with each `import_from_git` call over and over again...\r\nThe other one is that if `import_from_git` is not placed at the top of a _Fastfile_ it means some lanes or anything else might already been executed and would require to somehow reuse this _fastlane_ state in a new `bundle exec` call...\r\nTerrible idea that is why I am hiding it in the details \ud83d\ude03 \r\n</details>\r\n\r\nSo I guess it **cannot** be done due to usage of _bundler_.\r\n**But** if one is **not using** _bundler_ in a project (and hence both _Gemfile_ and _Pluginfile_), then they could just add plugins via `fastlane_require` action in a project _Fastfile_ or in an imported _Fastfile_.\r\nThis can be done in the current version of _fastlane_ and it works.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n> > Anyway, if this is not possible, can we add a note in `import_from_git` [description](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/import_from_git/) with reasoning if any?\r\n> \r\n> Documentation of that actions says:\r\n> \r\n> > Import another Fastfile from a remote git repository to use its lanes\r\n> \r\n> That is pretty clear that this action is for importing `Fastfile`s.\r\n\r\nExactly, that is why I was surprised that it imports all the files of custom actions as well and not only a _Fastfile_ ;). It is not even mentioned. And as plugins are just actions this is probably why people think that remote plugins should be imported or actually expect them to be imported implicitly like in a case of custom actions.\r\nBesides, searching for issues regarding `import_from_git` and _Pluginfile_ yields a lot of results so it seems like it is not so obvious for people and they constantly ask to support _Pluginfile_ in `import_from_git`.\r\nHence, I think an explanation with a good reasoning would be welcomed.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n> > Maybe it would be great to add a warning when `import_from_git` detects a _Pluginfile_ to remind that plugins should be installed/updated. I think it would follow _fastlane philosophy_.\r\n> \r\n> What do you mean by that? How should this work?\r\n> \r\nWhat I meant is that when `import_from_git` detects a _remote_ _Pluginfile_ (meaning in the same directory as the _Fastfile_ it tries to import) it could print a warning listing the plugin names and saying that in order to use this _remote_ _Fastfile_ these plugins are required to be in a _local_ _Pluginfile_.\r\nIt could even compare a _local_ _Pluginfile_ with a remote one and throw an error when it detects that plugins from a remote are not included in the local one. It would be very informative and helpful.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n> > Or _fastlane_require_plugin_ could be added in order to fail if there is no entry with a provided plugin name in a project _Pluginfile_?\r\n> \r\n> Doesn't this already happen when you use an action of a plugin, that is not installed?\r\n> \r\nYes I know that calling a plugin action would end up with an error but a usage of such an action might be somewhere far down the lanes \ud83d\ude04  i.e. after a long build or anything else.\r\nI think it is better to prevent such a _Fastfile_ from running at all as it will almost certainly finish with an error - so why wait for that?\r\nThis is just another way of prevention I have described above. This time using a `fastlane_require_plugin` as an action in a _remote_ _Fastfile_.\r\nInstead of adding a _remote_ _Pluginfile_ (like in a case above and handle that _Pluginfile_ in `import_from_git`) you could specify directly in a _remote_ _Fastfile_ that some plugins are required via `fastlane_require_plugin` action - this would work like in a case above - check if these plugins are in a _local_ _Pluginfile_ and then throw an error if missing.\r\n\r\nBoth of these preventions of course make sense if one is using _bundler_, _Gemfile_ and _Pluginfile_. Otherwise it is enough to use the current `fastlane_require` action and it will install a particular plugin gem (if necessary) upon running any lane from such a _Fastfile_.\r\nSo now both usages are handled.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n> That being said: You can of course create an action in your shared `Fastfile` that does exactly what I described above. Download some file, edit `Pluginfile` (or create it if it doesn'T exist) or add it additionally to `Gemfile`, then run `bundle install` using the `sh()` action. That would effectively \"force-install\" a plugin when your imported `Fastfile` is used. Would that solve your problem?\r\n\r\nLike I said above, if I use _bundler_ it is almost impossible (see details at the top). If I don't use _bundler_ (and thus neither _Gemfile_ nor _Pluginfile_) I can just require my plugins via `fastlane_require` and they will be installed if necessary.\r\n\r\n", "meta": {"posReactions": "0", "negReactions": "0"}}

As _Pluginfile_ requires _bundler_ and such a usage cannot be supported in `import_from_git` action.\r\n\r\nPut this in a remote _Fastfile_:\r\n`fastlane_require \"fastlane-plugin-clubmate\"`\r\nand you can just use this action in a lane like that:\r\n```\r\nlane :custom_lane do\r\n    clubmate\r\nend\r\n```\r\nwhen you **import** this _Fastfile_ in another one it will also **work**, providing that you do not use _bundler_.\r\n\r\n**The second** thing is that in my previous comment I have suggested adding some **improvements** (prevention steps) either in a form of a new action `fastlane_require_plugin` or additional safety-checks in `import_from_git` action to help mitigate issues when using plugins in a _remote_ _Fastfile_ (in a normal way with _bundler_).\r\n\r\nAs this issue is a _Feature_ _Request_ I was hoping to discuss all that and at the same time be proactive and bring up some ideas.\r\nBy looking at _fastlane_ issues I can see that using a _shared_ _Fastfile_ where one would like to use some plugins, is a problem raised many times and it probably needs some support.\r\n\r\nSo when using _bundler_ and importing a _remote_ _Fastfile_ it **cannot** be **guaranteed** that all the plugins used in this _remote_ _Fastfile_ are installed **locally**.\r\nWhat is more, it can be even unknown what plugins are required (without looking at the source of the _remote_ _Fastfile_) as there is no need to create (although it would be reasonable) a _Pluginfile_ for this _remote_ _Fastfile_.\r\nAnd as you can have multiple projects using a _shared_ _Fastfile_ and/or multiple _shared_ _Fastfiles_ it is easy to lose track of which plugins are required where - hence I wanted to improve that by giving some hints when importing a _shared/remote Fastfile_.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n> Besides that I honestly don't follow any more.
