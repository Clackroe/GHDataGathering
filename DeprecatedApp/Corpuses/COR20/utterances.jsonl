The value and use-cases for server-side APIs are well enumerated over hundreds of other tools. \r\n\r\nThat being said - opening up a server-to-server flow is more complicated than just documenting an API - since you have to support all of the \"interesting\" things folks will use it for. *Supporting* server data means that customers will try to send in web data, and offline data, and OTT data, etc. How do you accurately link up client-side and server-side identity? \r\n\r\nBy way of a guess - perhaps Google is in the process of combining GA and Firebase Analytics (frankly the branding is already getting conflated - they're calling it \"Google Analytics for Firebase\" as of this writing...), in which case it makes sense to hold off on releasing a true server-to-server flow. More conspiratorially, maybe they're deliberately limiting the use-cases for Firebase such that it's basically unusable for the enterprise businesses, who absolutely need a server-to-server flow, but who already are paying for GA 360.\r\n\r\nOnly time will tell!
