FSF was founded on some radically collectivist ideals. OSI on more radically libertarian ones. \"Open source principles\" are what they are because people planted the flag and did the work to make them that way. The reason this project is MIT instead of GPL in the first place is because of decades of ideological debate and changes in community expectations.\r\n\r\nPlanting a different flag and doing a different thing is not more or less political than the status quo. To suggest otherwise is ahistorical nonsense. It's not more political; it's merely more participatory.\r\n\r\nI'm simultaneously intrigued by the effort to change the license and skeptical of what its effects might be. Maybe reverting was a good idea! It would have for sure been _more interesting_ to see the experiment run its course, but I understand the fear to the health of the project that makes someone walk it back.\r\n\r\nOf course this attracted wider attention.
