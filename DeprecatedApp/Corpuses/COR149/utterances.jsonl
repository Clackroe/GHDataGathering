If anything, it seems more like an Atlas issue (so possibly the ELB and/or whatever's sitting behind it). I highly doubt it has anything to do with the routes or hops between end-users and the ELB VIPs -- you wouldn't typically see such a polarizing set of speeds in that case, especially considering both VIPs terminate in us-east-1.\n\nIf for no other reason, it'd be highly desirable to see these made available through a CDN rather than a centrally-located ELB.
