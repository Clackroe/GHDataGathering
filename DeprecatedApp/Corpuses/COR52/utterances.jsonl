This is one such experiment.\r \r **What's the experiment?** Whenever `standard` 14 is installed, we'll display a message from a company that supports open source. The sponsorship pays directly for maintainer time. That is, writing new features, fixing bugs, answering user questions, and improving documentation.\r \r **What's the goal?** My goal with this experiment is to make `standard` healthier. If we learn that the experiment works, perhaps we can help make all open source healthier, too.\u00a0For complex reasons, companies are generally hesitant or unwilling to fund OSS directly. When it does happen, it's never enough and it never reaches packages which are transitive dependencies (i.e. packages that no one installs explicitly and therefore no one knows exists). Essentially, we have a public good which is consumed by huge numbers of users, but which almost no one pays for. Fortunately, there exists a funding model that usually works for public goods like this \u2013\u00a0ads. The goal of this experiment is to answer the question: Can we use ethical ads \u2013\u00a0ads that don't track users or collect data \u2013\u00a0to fund open source software?\r \r **What does the code do?** The code for this experiment is available here: [`feross/funding`](https://github.com/feross/funding). Essentially, it calls `console.log()` on some text. There is no tracking, data collecting, or unexpected behavior. You can look at the code to verify \u2013 indeed, this is the beauty of open source!\r \r **What will the funds be used for?** The funds raised so far ($2,000) have paid for Feross's time to [release Standard 14](https://standardjs.com/changelog.html#1400---2019-08-19) which has taken around five days. If we are able to raise additional funds, the next thing I'd like to focus on is out-of-the-box TypeScript support in StandardJS (one of the most common feature requests!) and modernizing the various text editor plugins (many of which are currently unmaintained). If others in the community are interested in taking the lead on any of these issues, I'd like to direct some funds to you.\r \r Feedback welcome!\r \r ---\r \r ## EDIT: This thread is now locked :lock:\r \r For why + next steps, [scroll to the end >>](https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1381#issuecomment-524589455)\r \r ## EDIT: The experiment is over \u2013 Feross posted [a recap](https://feross.org/funding-experiment-recap/) on his blog", "meta": {"posReactions": "47", "negReactions": "704"}}

I do worry that `npm install` will just become a long trail of banner ads though eventually and it won't scale. Because if _every_ npm package adds ads, the noticeability of each ad will diminish. (Interestingly, the most valuable \"realestate\" will be packages whose banner is displayed _last_, so if it becomes a literal \"race-to-the-bottom\" people might add `sleep` statements to their post-install scripts so they are displayed nearest the bottom. What a dystopian installation experience!)\r\n\r\nFun fact: `yarn` does not display the output of post-install scripts.

Even worse, we must extract it on the disk (in case there's a build step) even if it's actually completely unnecessary (because you only print things). We've been exploring a lot of optimisations in this space lately (Yarn 2 will keep your packages within their archives by default), and this kind of pattern will prevent your users from exploiting them to full benefits.\r\n\r\n*(Note that I'm not saying the postinstall scripts are deprecated - just that they should be reserved to the use case they were designed for, which is building a package against a local environment)*\r\n\r\nFwiw, as is mentioned somewhere in this thread, Yarn already doesn't print the build logs unless they make the installs crash, so this post-install script wouldn't have any visible effect for our users.

At that time, adding a banner or two brought in revenue. People were clicking out of sheer novelty effect. But as it became more widespread, people started ignoring it. Then websites had to resort to more aggressive ads - animated banners, pop-ups, pop-unders. When those started getting blocked, they moved to advanced tracking.\r\nThe maintainer is getting $2000 for these banners because no one else is displaying ads there. Once other library authors notice this opportunity, they'll start adding ads too. Then the average payout comes down. But since we've already accepted ads here, some authors will include more annoying ads for slightly more money.
